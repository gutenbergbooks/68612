  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Amongst the nations of Europe most given
to letters, none have so largely contributed
to the general list of publications, relating
to the condition and progress of the different
countries of the world, as the English;
and no travellers possess to the same
degree as they do the love of describing
them, however numerous the accounts that
have preceded the period of their own experimental
observations. Their journals,
nevertheless, hardly ever fail to create
interest, and the least share of novelty in
form or matter induces the less travelling
class of their countrymen to read them
with pleasure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Turkey and Egypt in particular have
long been favourite themes; and indeed
the Ottoman empire in every point of
view, whether topographical, historical,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>administrative, religious, moral, political,
military, or commercial, offers an inexhaustible
subject for investigation, and an
endless excitement to curiosity. No regular
and minute description has, however,
yet been undertaken of two of its most important
and curious provinces, those which
divide the principal part of the ancient kingdom
of Dacia, under the modern denomination
of Wallachia and Moldavia, although
in the renewed existence of Greek governments
exercising most of the prerogatives
of independency, in the struggles of two
nations between a strong remnant of Dacian
barbarism and the influence of modern
civilisation, and in a country comprehending
within its own boundaries all the productive
resources which fall but separately
to the share of other countries, sufficient
matter may be found to render them a subject
by no means unworthy of notice.</p>

<p class='c007'>These considerations have encouraged
me to write the following pages with the
view of laying them before the public. An
official residence of some years in the
principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia,
afforded me the most ample opportunities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_v'>v</span>of observation on every thing they contain
most interesting, and I have endeavoured
to make an accurate and satisfactory description
of them. With regard to their
history, I have only dwelt upon the most
remarkable events, and have merely given
it that extent to which its degree of importance
seems entitled. I was apprehensive
that longer and more minute details might
be found tedious and unnecessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>I regret, however, that at the time I
wrote this account, I was not sufficiently
prepared to enter into further particulars
with respect to the minerals with which
those countries abound; I intend, if I return
to them, to bestow as much attention
as possible to that particular object, and to
make it the subject of a future separate
treatise.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am aware that my present undertaking
is deserving of an abler pen; but as the
character of nations can only be properly
understood after some length of residence
among them, I trust that the circumstances
which place it to my lot, will make the
apology of my intrusion, and become a
motive of indulgence to its deficiencies in
literary merit.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>As Wallachia was the country of my
fixed residence, I naturally chose it for the
principal scene of my observations; and
indeed the history of the two principalities
is throughout so intimately connected, the
form of their respective governments, the
language, manners, and customs of the
inhabitants, have ever been so much alike,
that a description of the one renders a
distinct account of the other superfluous.</p>

<p class='c007'>The political importance to which these
two provinces have risen since the reign of
the ambitious Catherine, has given them a
place of no small consequence in the general
balance of Europe. Most of the European
cabinets keep an eye upon them from the
same motives, though with different views;
but politics alone have hitherto brought
them into notice, and philosophically or
philanthropically speaking, it must be confessed
that a share of attention, directed by
common justice and humanity, was equally
due to their definitive fate.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have taken an opportunity of introducing
into my appendix, a very curious account
of the military system of the Ottoman
empire, translated from a Turkish manuscript
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>by an English gentleman, who possesses
a perfect knowledge of that language,
and who has favoured me with it. I have
added to it some explanatory notes, rendered
necessary by the metaphorical, and
in many parts, obscure style of the original
writing, and which my friend has purposely
translated in a literal sense, in order not to
divest it of that originality of narration
which constitutes a great share of its
interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>The work was written in 1804, by order
of the then reigning Sultan, Selim III.,
with the view of explaining the important
advantages of the new military institution,
called Nizam-y-Gedid, by which the Ottoman
armies were trained into a regular form
of discipline.</p>

<p class='c007'>This institution, however necessary, and
although strongly supported by all the
higher classes, was so violently opposed by
the clamorous janissaries, that at length it
became impossible to continue it, and since
the year 1805, the former regulations, or
rather irregularities, have again been prevalent
in the Ottoman armies. The same
disorders which the Turkish author so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>faithfully describes as having existed before
the introduction of the Nizam-y-Gedid,
have necessarily followed its abolishment,
and Turkey will no longer trust to her own
means for salvation in future war. Her
last one with Russia has made her feel but
too sensibly how far the present form of
discipline of her armies may prove fatal to
her existence, if ever she is abandoned to
herself for defence.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>The principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia,
situated between 43° 40′ and 48° 50′
north latitude, 23° and 29° 30′ east longitude,
occupying a space of 350 miles in
length, and 160 in breadth, are separated
from the Austrian provinces of Temesvar,
Transylvania, and Boukovina, by the Carpathian
mountains; from Russia, by the
river Pruth; and from Bulgaria (the ancient
Mœsia), by the Danube.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>It is sufficiently ascertained that these two
provinces, joined to those of Transylvania
and Temesvar, composed the kingdom of
Dacia, finally conquered by the Romans.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Dacians were originally a Scythian
or Sarmatian tribe, resembling, in language
and manners, the Thracians; the Greeks,
indeed, considered them as a part of the
Thracian nation.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were a sober and vigorous people,
capable of enduring any hardships and
privations in war: they did not fear exposing
themselves to the greatest dangers,
because they looked upon death as the
beginning of a much happier life; and this
doctrine, according to Strabo, they held
from a philosopher named Zamolxis, who
was held in high repute by them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The progress of the Roman arms, which,
under the reign of Augustus, were carried
to the banks of the Danube, brought them
into contact with the Dacians, who were
at that time governed by a warlike prince
named Bærebestes, who boldly set the
Roman conquerors at defiance. After his
death, they were divided into four or five
different principalities, and their strength
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>was a good deal broken by the Romans;
but their last king Decebalus, one of the
ablest and most enterprising warriors of his
time, re-united them into one body towards
the 87th year of the Christian æra.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first irruption of the Dacians into
the territory of the empire, took place
during the latter part of Augustus’s reign;
and, at times repulsed, at other times successful,
they continued to annoy the
Romans without any decisive advantage
taking place on either side. At last the
Emperor Domitian, determined to put a
stop to their depredations, marched in
person against them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The particulars of the war which ensued
are sufficiently detailed in the Roman history.
The result of it having been such as to
compel Domitian to sue for peace; he consented
to pay to Decebalus an annual sum in
the shape of a pension, but which, in fact,
was nothing less than a tribute. It was
regularly paid by the Romans until the year
102, when the Emperor Trajan declared his
resolution to discontinue it; and the
Dacians thereby considering themselves no
longer bound to observe the treaty of peace,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>crossed the Danube, and laid waste the
Roman territory. Upon these acts of hostility,
Trajan put himself at the head of a
numerous army, and marching against
them, forced them to retire, passed the
Danube in pursuit, engaged and defeated
their successive forces, and finally compelled
Decebalus to acknowledge himself his vassal.
Trajan then returned to Rome, where he
received the honour of a triumph, and the
title of <em>Dacicus</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>But not long after, Decebalus, eager to
shake off the Roman yoke, invaded and
plundered the territory of his neighbours
the Iazygæ, who were also tributary to the
empire, on their refusal to join him against
the Romans. Trajan again took the field
at the head of a vast army, determined to
chastise and subdue the Dacians. He
reached the banks of the Danube in
Autumn, and he thought it prudent to
wait there the return of the fine season, that
he might carry on military operations with
more facility and success. It was during
this interval, that he caused his famous
bridge to be built over the Danube, under
the direction of the architect Apollodorus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>of Damascus; and its present remains are
sufficiently visible to verify the ancient accounts
of this stupendous work. When
the water is very low, some of the piles
stand two or three feet above it, and render
that part of the river difficult of navigation;
they are looked upon as rocks by the natives
of each side.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the return of the Spring, when the
bridge was completed, the Roman army
marched over it, and commenced hostilities.
The war was long and difficult, but it terminated
in the complete subjugation of the
Dacians, and in the death of their king,
Decebalus, who, finding it impossible to
avoid being made prisoner, killed himself
that he might not fall alive into the conquerors’
hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dacia was thus converted into a Roman
province, and Trajan shortly after sent
colonies to increase its population. New
cities were built, and pavements were constructed
on the high roads, for the greater
facility of communication.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a> It was governed
by a Roman pro-prætor until the year 274.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>Under the reign of Gallienus, when the
empire was already declining, various parts
of Dacia were seized by the Goths, and
other barbarous nations.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few Roman legions yet remained in
the country, under the reign of the Emperor
Aurelian, who, returning from Gaul, came
down to Illyria, and finding a great part of
Dacia in the hands of the barbarians, foresaw
the impossibility of maintaining any
possessions in the midst of them, and he
withdrew a good number of the Roman inhabitants
to the other side of the Danube,
and settled them in Mæsia.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the space of a hundred years from
that period, those of the natives who had
remained behind, and their descendants,
were incessantly exposed to the rapacities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>of a variety of barbarous tribes, who came
into the country for plunder.</p>

<p class='c007'>Towards the year 361, the Goths, more
powerful than the rest, seemed to have
been left in exclusive possession of the province,
and were inclined to make a permanent
stay in it. They embraced the
Christian religion, and established it in
Dacia; since when, to the present moment,
it has never ceased to be predominant
amongst its inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 376, the Hunns, having over-run the
countries possessed by the Goths, forced
Athanaric, King of the Vizigoths, to retire
with all his forces to that part of Dacia,
situated between the rivers Dniester and
Danube, now called Moldavia. He raised
a wall between the latter river and the
Pruth, by which he thought himself sufficiently
protected against the attacks of his
enemies. The Hunns, however, were not
stopped by it; and their approach spread
such consternation among the Goths of
the interior, that those who had the means
of escaping, to the number of some hundred
thousand, fled for refuge into the
Roman territory, and were permitted by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Emperor Valens, to settle in Thrace, upon
condition that they should live peaceably
there, and serve, when required, in the
Roman armies.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Hunns having penetrated into Dacia,
were left masters of it until the year 453,
when Ardaric, King of the Gepidæ, a people
previously conquered by Attila and the
Hunns, revolted against them, in consequence
of Attila’s death. His son and successor,
Ellach, marched against them, but
being defeated and slain, the Hunns were
driven back into Scythia, and the Gepidæ
remained masters of all Dacia. They
entered into a sort of alliance with the
Romans, who agreed to pay them a pension.
In 550, their first quarrels with their
neighbours, the Lombards, took place; and
being sometimes assisted by the Emperor
Justinian, they carried on frequent hostilities
against them, for the space of eight
years, at the end of which both nations
resolved to decide the fate of the war by
one great battle. The Lombards, under
their King Alboin, had previously formed
an alliance with the Avars, a people of
Scythian extraction; and, assisted by them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>they marched to action. Both sides fought
with equal valor; but at last victory declared
in favour of the Lombards, who, pursuing
the Gepidæ, made a great slaughter
among them. The Gepidæ, either destroyed,
dispersed, or subdued, never after
had a king of their own, and ceased to be
a nation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alboin’s achievements in Dacia attracted
the notice of Narses, sent by Justinian to
conquer Italy: he made offers to him, and
finally engaged him to join the expedition
with all his forces. The Lombards thus
abandoned their possessions in Dacia and
Pannonia to their friends and neighbours
the Avars. These, also known by the
name of White-Hunns, remained in them
until their own destruction by the Franks
and Bulgarians. In the 7th century, being
joined by other barbarous tribes, they
pushed their incursions as far as the gates
of Constantinople, where they were so
completely defeated by the Emperor Heraclius,
that they could not recover the blow:
it was the original cause of their rapid
decline.</p>

<p class='c007'>Towards the close of the same century,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>a nation, known under the names of Slaves
and Bulgarians, came from the interior of
Russia to that part of Mæsia, which has
since been called Bulgaria. Soon after a
great number of Slaves, headed by their
chief Krumo, crossed the Danube, and
settled in Dacia, where they have since
been known under the name of <em>Wallachs</em>.
Opinion varies with respect to the origin
of this name. Some historians pretend
that the Slaves distinguished by it the
Romans of Mæsia; whilst others maintain
that they meant by it a people who led a pastoral
life, and had given it to the inhabitants
of Mæsia, most of whom were shepherds;
and that a great number of these, having
joined the Slaves in Dacia, the name by
degrees became a general one amongst its
inhabitants. The modern Wallachians,
however, exclude it altogether from their
language, and call themselves “Rumunn”
or Romans, giving to their country the
name of Roman-land, “Tsara-Rumaneska.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Some former inhabitants of Dacia, joined
by a number of Slaves and Bulgarians,
separated from the new settlers, and went
to the lower part of Dacia lying between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>the rivers Olt and Danube, where they
fixed their habitations. They formed
themselves into a nation, and chose for
their chief one <em>Bessarabba</em>, to whom they
gave the Slavonic title of <em>Bann</em> or regent.
The country within his jurisdiction was
called <em>Bannat</em>; and it retains to this day the
name of Bannat of Crayova, the latter being
that of its present capital. Several other
petty independent states arose at the same
time in various parts of Dacia; but they
were frequently annexed to the same sceptre,
at other periods dismembered, according
to the warlike ardour or indolence and
incapacity of their various chiefs. Their
general system, however, consisted in making
war against the Romans of the lower
empire, in which they were seconded by
the Slaves and Bulgarians of Mæsia, whom
they looked upon as their natural allies.
This state of things continued to the close
of the 9th century, at which period the
Slaves having fallen into decline, various
hordes, originally Scythians, successively
undertook the conquest of Dacia, driving
each other out of it, according to the momentary
superiority of the one over the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>other. The most remarkable of these were
the Hazars, the Patzinaces, the Moangoures,
the Ouzes, the Koumans, and other
Tartars.</p>

<p class='c007'>The natives were treated as slaves by all
these hordes of barbarian intruders, and
great numbers of them were continually
retiring to the other side of the Carpathians;
where they settled under their own chiefs,
sometimes independent, at others tributary
to the kings of Hungary. The most conspicuous
and thriving of these colonies
were those of Fagarash and Maramosh.</p>

<p class='c007'>The devastations continued in the plains
finally drove out all the natives, and in the
11th century the Tartars retired, leaving
the country a complete desert. It remained
in this state until the year 1241, when the
inhabitants of Fagarash, conducted by their
chief Raddo Negro (Rodolphus the Black),
crossed the mountains, and took possession
of that tract of country, which is now called
Upper Wallachia. Nearly at the same
time, the inhabitants of Maramosh under
their chief Bogdan, came and settled in that
part which is by some called Moldavia,
from the name of the river Moldau, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>crosses it to fall into the Danube, and by
the natives and Turks, Bogdania. Raddo
Negro and his followers halted at the foot
of the mountains, where they laid the
foundation of a city, to which they gave
the name of Kimpolung. At present it is reduced
to an indifferent village; but its original
extent is marked by old walls in ruin;
and some inscriptions in its cathedral church
attest it to have been Raddo’s capital. His
successors transferred their residence to
Tirgovist, more pleasantly situated in the
plains.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some Wallachian, Transylvanian, and
Hungarian authors differ in opinion with
respect to the exact period of Raddo’s and
Bogdan’s establishment in Wallachia and
in Moldavia, and fix it at a different year
of the early part of the 13th century; but
as they give no satisfactory explanation on
the subject, I am disposed to differ from
them all, in placing that event in the year
1241, on the strength of the following considerations:—1st.
It does not appear probable
that the kings of Hungary, who, at
the commencement of the 13th century
were very powerful, and who looked upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Fagarash and Maramosh as dependencies
of their crown, would have suffered their
inhabitants to desert them, in order to settle
in foreign countries: 2dly, It would
seem strange that Raddo, Bogdan, and
their followers should have quitted their
homes in a prosperous country, and come
to inhabit a desert, without some extraordinary
event had necessitated so remarkable
an emigration: and 3dly, the best
Hungarian historians place in the year
1240 the invasion of Battou-Han in the
northern countries; and add, that having
crossed Russia and Poland at the head of
500,000 men, he entered Hungary in the
year 1241, where he staid three years,
during which he put every thing to fire
and sword, and finally retired because
nothing more was left to satisfy his thirst of
blood.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a> It appears, then, extremely probable
that the ravages of Battou-Han, and
the terror he spread in the adjacent provinces,
were the only causes of this emigration,
which no historian has yet otherwise
accounted for.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Bogdan and Raddo assumed the Slavonic
title of Voïvode, equivalent to that of commanding
prince. When tranquillity was
restored in Hungary, they acknowledged
the supremacy of the Hungarian king; but
it does not appear that the formalities of
the recognition had been such as to bind
their successors; for, at the early part of
the principalities, some Voïvodes disputed
it with success; and from the commencement
of the 14th century, their independency
was acknowledged by Hungary.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Bannat of Crayova had been little
molested during the great incursions of the
barbarians: in the 9th century it had become
tributary to the kings of Hungary,
who afterwards held it as a sort of refuge
for the knights going to, and coming from,
the Holy Land; but soon after Raddo’s
arrival, the Bann submitted to him the
supreme sovereignty of the Bannat, and it
has since then been annexed to the principality
of Wallachia.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the latter part of his life, Raddo
raised another city, distant about thirty
miles south-west of Kimpolung, on the
borders of the river Argis: he gave it the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>name of Courté d’Argis, and resided in it
occasionally. He also built a church here,
which, two hundred years after, one of the
Voïvodes beautified in a very conspicuous
manner. The whole of the exterior work
is entirely of carved marble, something in the
style of the steeple of St. Stephen’s church
at Vienna, but far more elegant. The whole
produces a very striking effect; and, as it
has perfectly preserved its original beauty,
it is certainly a monument that the Wallachians
may boast of in any part of Europe.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Voïvodate was not made hereditary;
and although it devolved sometimes from
father to son, the successor was obliged
to go through the formality of being
elected by the chiefs of the nation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Several successors of Raddo strengthened
the government, the population increased,
and a great number of small towns and
villages were built in the country. Frequent
hostilities against the Hungarians,
arising from the claims of sovereignty of
the latter, accustomed the Wallachians to
war; and in 1391 the Voïvoide Mirtza collected
a numerous force, and attacked the
neighbouring possessions of the Turks with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>the view of rescuing them from their hands.
The Sultan Bajazet being at that moment
employed in Asia in a troublesome war
with the Prince of Castomona, had left his
conquests near the Danube without the
means of defence. But when the news of
their invasion reached him, he suspended
his operations in Asia, and returned to
Adrianople, from whence he sent a numerous
army to Wallachia. The Voïvode
marched to meet the Turks; and, after a
bloody battle, he was defeated, and compelled
to become tributary to the Sultan.
The annual amount of the tribute was
fixed at three thousand piasters.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Wallachia continued to pay it until the
year 1444; when Ladislas King of Hungary,
preparing to make war against the Turks,
engaged the Voïvode Dracula to form an
alliance with him. The Hungarian troops
marched through the principality and were
joined by four thousand Wallachians under
the command of Dracula’s son.<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c012'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>The Hungarians being defeated at the
celebrated battle of Varna, Hunniades their
general, and regent of the kingdom during
Ladislas’s minority, returned in haste to
make new preparations for carrying on the
war. But the Voïvode, fearful of the Sultan’s
vengeance, arrested and kept him
prisoner during a year, pretending thereby
to show to the Turks that he treated him
as an enemy. The moment Hunniades
reached Hungary, he assembled an army
and placed himself at the head of it, returned
to Wallachia, attacked and defeated
the Voïvode, and caused him to be beheaded
in his presence; after which he raised to
the Voïvodate one of the primates of the
country, of the name of <em>Dan</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Wallachians under this Voïvode
joined again the Hungarians in 1448, and
made war on Turkey; but being totally
defeated at the battle of Cossova, in Bulgaria,
and finding it no longer possible to
make any stand against the Turks, they
submitted again to the annual tribute, which
they paid until the year 1460, when the
Sultan Mahomet II. being occupied in
completing the conquest of the islands in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>the Archipelago, afforded them a new opportunity
of shaking off the yoke. Their
Voïvode, also named Dracula<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c012'><sup>[5]</sup></a>, did not
remain satisfied with mere prudent measures
of defence: with an army he crossed
the Danube and attacked the few Turkish
troops that were stationed in his neighbourhood;
but this attempt, like those of
his predecessors, was only attended with
momentary success. Mahomet having
turned his arms against him, drove him
back to Wallachia, whither he pursued and
defeated him. The Voïvode escaped into
Hungary, and the Sultan caused his brother
Bladus to be named in his place. He made
a treaty with Bladus, by which he bound
the Wallachians to perpetual tribute; and
laid the foundations of that slavery, from
which no efforts have yet had the power of
extricating them with any lasting efficacy.
The following is the substance of the
treaty:—</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>1. “The Sultan consents and engages
for himself and his successors, to give protection
to Wallachia, and to defend it
against all enemies, assuming nothing more
than a supremacy over the sovereignty of
that principality, the Voïvodes of which
shall be bound to pay to the Sublime Porte
an annual tribute of ten thousand piasters.”</p>

<p class='c007'>2. “The Sublime Porte shall never interfere
in the local administration of the
said principality, nor shall any Turk be
ever permitted to come into Wallachia
without an ostensible reason.”</p>

<p class='c007'>3. “Every year an officer of the Porte
shall come to Wallachia to receive the
tribute, and on his return shall be accompanied
by an officer of the Voïvode as far
as Giurgevo on the Danube, where the
money shall be counted over again, a second
receipt given for it, and when it has been
carried in safety to the other side of that
river, Wallachia shall no longer be responsible
for any accident that may befall it.”<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c012'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>4. “The Voïvodes shall continue to be
elected by the archbishop, metropolitan,
bishops, and boyars<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c012'><sup>[7]</sup></a>, and the election
shall be acknowledged by the Porte.”</p>

<p class='c007'>5. “The Wallachian nation shall continue
to enjoy the free exercise of their own
laws; and the Voïvodes shall have the right
of life and death over their own subjects, as
well as that of making war and peace,
without having to account for any such
proceedings to the Sublime Porte.”</p>

<p class='c007'>6. “All Christians who, having once
embraced the Mahometan faith, should
come into Wallachia and resume the Christian
religion, shall not be claimed by any
Ottoman authorities.”</p>

<p class='c007'>7. “Wallachian subjects who may have
occasion to go into any part of the Ottoman
dominions, shall not be there called
upon for the haratsh or capitation tax paid
by other <em>Rayahs</em>.”<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c012'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>8. “If any Turk have a lawsuit in Wallachia
with a subject of the country, his
cause shall be heard and decided by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Wallachian divan, conformably to the local
laws.”</p>

<p class='c007'>9. “All Turkish merchants coming to
buy and sell goods in the principality,
shall, on their arrival, have to give notice
to the local authorities of the time necessary
for their stay, and shall depart when
that time is expired.”</p>

<p class='c007'>10. “No Turk is authorised to take
away one or more servants of either sex,
natives of Wallachia; and no Turkish
mosque shall ever exist on any part of the
Wallachian territory.”</p>

<p class='c007'>11. “The Sublime Porte promises never
to grant a Ferman<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c012'><sup>[9]</sup></a> at the request of a
Wallachian subject for his affairs in Wallachia,
of whatever nature they may be; and
never to assume the right of calling to
Constantinople, or to any other part of the
Turkish dominions, a Wallachian subject
on any pretence whatever.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This treaty in many respects advantageous
to Wallachia, still forms the basis
of its constitution. The first, third, fourth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>and latter part of the fifth articles only,
have since undergone alterations, which
have proved in no small degree detrimental
to the liberties of that country. The remainder
have been, and are to this day,
punctually observed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The qualification of a mere tributary
prince did not, however, appear to the
Sultan Mahomet as implying sufficient
submission; and, in order to place the person
of the Voïvode under a more immediate
dependence, he gave him the rank
and title of a Turkish Pashah; a dignity,
which has ever since been inseparable from
that of Voïvode or Hospodar.</p>

<p class='c007'>The principality remained in a peaceable
state several years after its war with Mahomet,
and the weakness and incapacity of
several of its princes afforded to the Ottoman
court the means of ruling over it with
increasing power. In 1544 portions of
territory bordering on the Danube were
ceded to the Turks; the fortresses of
Ibraïl, Giurgevo, and Tourno, which have
much figured in all the subsequent European
wars of Turkey, were raised upon them,
and were garrisoned by Turkish soldiers.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Having gained so strong a footing in the
country, the conduct of the Turks became
more and more overbearing: its rights and
privileges were no longer respected; and
the Porte countenanced, or connived at,
every sort of depredation committed by
the soldiers of the garrisons beyond the
boundaries of the fortresses; and soon
treated the principality and its inhabitants
as on the same footing with all its other
Christian conquests.</p>

<p class='c007'>This state of things continued to the
year 1593, when an individual of the name
of Michael was elected to the Voïvodate.
He no sooner held the reins of government
than he determined to deliver his country
from the Turkish yoke, and restore it to
independency. Circumstances soon afforded
him an opportunity of putting this plan
into execution. The Prince Sigismund of
Transylvania, also tributary to the Turks,
revolted against them towards this period,
at the instigations of the Pope and of the
Emperor Rodolphus. With him and with
the Voïvode Aaron of Moldavia, Michael
formed a league against the enemies of
Christianity. But in order to give a greater
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>appearance of justice to their proceedings,
the allies sent a long list of grievances to
the Porte, demanded redress, and insisted
that some satisfactory guarantee were given
of a change of system for the future. These
representations not only remained unanswered,
but, shortly after they were made,
a troop of three thousand Janissaries came
into Wallachia, and went about the country,
levying contributions on the villagers, and
committing all sorts of outrages. A Wallachian
force was at last sent against them,
and they were all put to the sword; after
which, Michael, at the head of an army
composed of his own troops and those of
his allies, marched against Giurgevo, and
compelled its garrison to retire to the other
side of the Danube.</p>

<p class='c007'>The threatening attitude of Michael and
his allies induced the Sultan Amurat to
desist from further provocation, and to
wait for a more favourable moment of imposing
again his yoke on the principalities;
but he died suddenly in 1595, and his successor,
Mahomet III., no sooner ascended
the throne than he resolved to carry that
plan into execution by the means of an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>overpowering army. Forty thousand Turks
and twenty thousand Tartars, under the
orders of the Grand Vezier, invaded the
Wallachian and Moldavian provinces
nearly at the same time, and a long war
ensued. The invaders suffered a series of
defeats: for five years they renewed the
campaign with no better success; and the
Sultan was finally compelled to relinquish
his claims.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1600, after the abdication of Sigismund
of Transylvania, that principality
became tributary to the Emperor Rodolphus;
and as the Voïvode Michael, whom
the emperor had engaged into his interests,
had assisted him in defeating the schemes
of Cardinal Battori, pretender to the Transylvanian
sovereignty, Rodolphus, to reward
him, left him the government of
Transylvania. The Voïvode fixed his residence
in that province, and appointed a
lieutenant in Wallachia. But in the following
year the Transylvanians, not satisfied
with his administration, revolted, and
sent invitations to their former Prince,
Sigismund, who was living as a private
individual at Clausenburg, to come and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>resume the supreme authority. An Austrian
army, under the command of General
Baste, was hastily dispatched to stop the
progress of the rebellion; and Michael, who
had repaired to Wallachia, returned with
some troops, and joined the imperial
general. They marched together against
the rebels, who had formed an army of
equal strength, and an obstinate battle took
place, which terminated in the entire defeat
of the insurgents, and in the subjection of
the whole province. When events had
determined the fate of Transylvania, the
two allied commanders quarrelled in a discussion
concerning the ulterior measures of
administration; and Baste, resolved by
some means or other to get rid of Michael,
whose pretensions appeared to him to have
become of a dangerous tendency, caused
him to be assassinated. The Wallachian
troops were sent back to their country,
and they carried away with them the head
of the Voïvode Michael, which was buried
in the monastery of <em>Dialloluy</em>, near the
town of Tirgovist, where the monument
that was placed over it at the time, with an
inscription alluding to the principal events
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>of his life, and to the circumstances of his
death, engraved in Slavonian characters,
still exists.</p>

<p class='c007'>The death of Michael, which took place
in 1602, spread great consternation and
confusion in Wallachia. The Primates<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c012'><sup>[10]</sup></a>
lost time in deliberations on the measures
that were to be pursued; and the Turkish
Pashahs of the neighbourhood sent a strong
body of troops, which, crossing the Danube
at different places, occupied the greatest
part of the principality, and put it out of
the power of the Wallachians to make any
effectual resistance. The sultan’s orders
for the election of a Voïvode of his own
choice were soon obeyed, and the principality
resumed its tributary character; the
treaty of Mahomet II. was renewed, but
the amount of the tribute was fixed at a
much higher sum. From this period forward,
Wallachia remained under the power
of the Ottoman Sultans; and although
its inhabitants, in the course of the 17th
century, made frequent efforts to throw off
the yoke, the success of such attempts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>always proved momentary, and consequently
more injurious than beneficial to
them in the sequel.</p>

<p class='c007'>With regard to Moldavia, the first act of
its submission to the Turks was not the
effect of conquest, but a voluntary measure
of precaution and security.<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c012'><sup>[11]</sup></a> It was only
in 1536 that this principality consented to
become tributary to the Sultan, and the
event is thus explained by all the Moldavian
historians.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1529 the Voïvode Stephen, being on
his death-bed, called to him his son Bogdan,
who was likely to succeed him, and
his principal nobles: he addressed them at
length on the political situation of the
country, representing the probability of its
being soon attacked by the Turks, and the
insufficiency of its means to make any
effectual resistance against their power.
He dwelt on the ferocious character of the
reigning Sultan Suleÿman I., and recommended
to them in the strongest manner,
rather to seek his clemency by the voluntary
offer of a tribute, than expose themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>to his vengeance in resisting his
attempts to obtain it.</p>

<p class='c007'>After Stephen’s death, Bogdan neglected
some years his father’s advice, till at last he
saw the necessity of following it; and he
sent, in 1536, ambassadors to Constantinople
to offer the tribute. The Sultan then
entered into written engagements with him,
by which the same privileges as those of
Wallachia were granted to Moldavia; but
in which the tribute was merely called a
<em>Peshkicsh</em>, or present.</p>

<p class='c007'>Moldavia was governed on the same
plan as the sister province, and frequently
shared the same fate in war; sometimes
ravaged by the Turks, at other times successful
in resisting them. Towards the
close of the 16th century, after its successful
co-operation with Wallachia, Sigismund
of Transylvania seized it, deposed the
Voïvode Aaron, his friend and ally, and
appointed a man of his own choice, whom
he bound to pay him tribute. But in 1597,
a Polish army invaded the province, and
rescued it from the hands of Sigismund.
In 1602 the Poles restored it to the Turks,
against whose power the Moldavians never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>after struggled with any permanent success.
Their frequent and fruitless efforts to regain
independency, exhausted their means
and patriotic ardour; and by degrees they
became accustomed to the Turkish yoke.
The appointment of the Voïvodes was left
to the pleasure of the Sultans, although the
formality of the election continued to take
place a long time after; but the tribute was
no longer called a present, and its amount was
increased at almost every new appointment.</p>

<p class='c007'>As far, however, as the end of the 17th
century, intervening political motives still
induced the Porte to show some deference
to the privileges of the two principalities;
but at the early part of the 18th century,
the Ottoman Court became less constrained
in its policy, and in assuming the right of
punishing by death the Wallachian princes,
laid the foundations of that system by
which both have been governed to the
present moment. The event which proved
so fatal to the respective constitutions of
those states, will show at the same time
how far their public spirit must have been
subdued, and how rapid appears to have
been its decline.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>During the reign of Sultan Ahmet, the
Porte had, in 1695, declared war against
the Emperor; and the Voïvode Constantine
Brancovano Bessarabba of Wallachia
was directed to form an army, and to march
into the Austrian states, in order to second
the operations of the Grand Vizier who was
to commence hostilities from the frontiers
of Servia. The Voïvode partly obeyed; but,
either from a secret hatred to the Turks, or
from being bribed into the Emperor’s
cause, probably from both these motives,
he abstained from taking any active part in
the campaign, and by that circumstance
alone, favoured the operations of the Austrians.
At the conclusion of the peace of
Carlowitz, the Emperor Leopold rewarded
the Voïvode’s services by conferring on him
the title of Prince of the Roman Empire,
together with the gift of some landed estates
in Transylvania. These circumstances
could not remain hidden from the knowledge
of the Ottoman court, who, however,
found it necessary to use dissimulation; and
some years elapsed without any notice being
taken of them.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>In 1710, Bessarabba was drawn into a secret
correspondence with the Czar Peter the
great, the object of which was to obtain his co-operation
in that sovereign’s projected war
against the Turks. The Voïvode promised
a contingent of thirty thousand men, and
an ample supply of provisions and other
necessaries for the Russian army.</p>

<p class='c007'>The purport of this correspondence became
known to the Porte, and the death of
Bessarabba was immediately determined
upon; but at the same time it was deemed
adviseable to use stratagem instead of open
force, and it was resolved that he should be
drawn into a snare by the Prince of Moldavia.
Nicholas Marrocordato then governed
that province, but he was thought unfit for
the execution of the plan; the Porte therefore
recalled him, and appointed to the
principality Demetrius Cantimir, whose
fidelity had been frequently tried both in
peace and war. Cantimir set out from
Constantinople for Moldavia, having instructions
and positive orders to seize
Bessarabba under the colour of friendship,
alliance, or any pretence which he might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>think proper, and send him alive or dead
to Constantinople.<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c012'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>But Cantimir, who, it seems, had neither
the ambition nor the desire of being made
Voïvode of Moldavia, having twice before
procured that principality to his younger
brother Antiochus, accepted it with the
express condition that he should not be
called upon to pay any tribute, or to make
any of the presents customary at the new
nominations. But when he reached Moldavia
the Grand Vezier wrote to him by the
Sultan’s order, not only to send immediately
the usual tribute and presents, but
also to prepare provisions for a numerous
Turkish army, to throw a bridge over the
Danube for their passage, and to join the
Turks in person with Moldavian troops,
besides other intolerable burthens.<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c012'><sup>[13]</sup></a> Cantimir
says, that perceiving now how little
faith was to be expected from the infidels,
and esteeming it far better to suffer for the
Christian cause, he resolved to detach himself
from the Turkish interest, and sent a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>faithful messenger to the Czar, with an
offer of his services and principality.</p>

<p class='c007'>With these favourable prospects in
Wallachia and in Moldavia, the Czar advanced
towards the Ottoman frontiers. In
1711, he arrived with all his forces at
Yassi, where he remained some days in expectation
of the contingent and provisions
promised by the Voïvode of Wallachia.
But it seems that Bessarabba, as the rupture
between the Sultan and the Czar drew
near, alarmed at the great preparations of
the Turks, and the approach of their army,
composed of two hundred and twenty
thousand men, thought it prudent to take
no part in the war, and the subsequent
disasters of the Russians are in a great
measure attributed to the failure of his
former promises to the Czar, who had
placed too great a reliance in them. The
events of this war are too well known to
need any further explanation here. When
peace was restored, and the Voïvodate of
Moldavia had remained vacant by Cantimir’s
defection, Nicholas Marrocordato was
again appointed to it. Bessarabba remained
unmolested, but not without the fear of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>early vengeance. Eager to regain the favour
of the Ottoman government, and to obtain
the assurance of oblivion on the past, he
sent large supplies of money, and considerable
presents to the Turkish ministers, and
to the public treasures; he repeated them
so often, as to convince the court that he
possessed immense wealth, and the Grand
Vezier, Ally-Pashah, who was his personal
enemy, obtained from the Sultan a formal
order for his recall, and for the seizure of
his treasures. The Vezier then formed the
plan of enforcing this order, and it was
carried into execution in the following
manner:—</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1714, at the beginning of April, being
the week of the Passion, when the attention
of the Wallachians and their occupations
were entirely devoted to the long ceremonies
of the Greek church, a Capigee-Bashi<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c012'><sup>[14]</sup></a>, of
the Sultan, arrived at Bukorest with a suite
of a hundred men; he sent word to the
Voïvode that he was on his way to Hotim
upon very pressing business of the state,
and that he should only have time to pay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>him a visit on the next morning, after
which he intended to take his departure.
Accordingly, he went the next day to the
palace, and, on entering the closet of the
Voïvode, who stood up to receive him, he
placed a black handkerchief on his shoulder,
conformably to the then usual method of
announcing depositions to persons high in
office in Turkey. The Voïvode was confounded
by the unexpected compliment,
but the moment he recovered from his first
emotions, he burst into a long strain of
invectives against the Sultan and the Turks,
for treating him with so much ingratitude
after the many services he had rendered to
the Porte. The Capigee, however, placed
a guard about his person, and proceeded to
the divan chamber, where he read a <em>Ferman</em>,
which contained the decree of Bessarabba’s
deposition, declared him a traitor, and
ordered him to Constantinople with all his
family. After the <em>Ferman</em> had been published,
the Capigee secured the public
treasure, and all the Voïvode’s private
property. The frightened inhabitants of
Bukorest remained tranquil spectators of
all these acts of violence, and made no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>effort to release the Voïvode from his imprisonment.
With a nation more awakened
to its own dignity, and to the value of independence,
an event of this nature would
not, perhaps, have taken place without the
support of an army, and the shedding of
blood; and, indeed, the circumstances of
this very occurrence would hardly appear
credible, if they were not almost fresh in
the memory of the present generation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two days after Bessarabba’s deposition,
one Stephen Cantacuzene, of Greek origin,
and calling himself a descendant of the
imperial family of that name<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c012'><sup>[15]</sup></a>, was, by the
Sultan’s order, raised to the Voïvodate.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 14th April, the Capigee-Bashi
left Bukorest with Bessarabba, his wife,
four sons, three daughters, and grandson,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>and escorted by the Turkish guard. They
soon reached Constantinople, and the Voïvode,
with all his family, was immediately
confined in the state prison of the Seven
Towers. His treasures not being found so
considerable as had been expected, his sons
were put to the torture for three successive
days, that they might confess where their
father had hidden the rest; or that the
latter, being a witness to his children’s
torments, might come forward and make
that confession himself. But as these
cruelties did not produce the intended
effect, the Sultan, exasperated at the apparent
obstinacy of the sufferers, ordered
them to be executed in his presence. The
prisoners were conducted to a square, under
the windows of the seraglio, and a long list
of accusations was read to them; it alluded
particularly to the treachery of Bessarabba
in the Austrian war, and to the indignant
expressions he had made use of against the
person of the Sultan, when his recall had
been signified to him. The four sons were
first beheaded, one after the other, and the
execution of the father closed this scene of
butchery. When the Sultan withdrew, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>five heads were put upon pikes, and carried
about the streets of Constantinople. The
bodies were thrown into the sea, but they
were picked up by some Christian boatmen,
and conveyed to a Greek monastery in the
little island of Halcky, in the Propontis,
where they received burial.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to the unfortunate princess and the
remainder of her family, they were shortly
after exiled to Cuttaya, in Asia Minor, but
three years after they were permitted to
return to Wallachia.<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c012'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Voïvode Cantacuzene only remained
in office two years, and he was the last
Wallachian prince, whose nomination was
effected through the formality of election.
This important prerogative of the inhabitants
had been abolished some years
before in Moldavia. The Porte found it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>unnecessary to suffer it any longer in Wallachia,
and indeed it had, since more than
a century, become merely nominal.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nicholas Marrocordato was transferred
from the government of Moldavia to that
of Wallachia, and proclaimed by a Turkish
Capigee-Bashi in 1716. At this time the
Porte was preparing to carry on a defensive
war against Austria; and had the primates
of Wallachia felt the courage to protest
against so manifest a violation of their
privileges, they would, most probably, have
succeeded in securing a better observance
of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since the commencement of the decline
of the Turkish power, the Ottoman court
has made it an invariable policy to infringe
little by little on the privileges allowed to
foreign nations by treaty; and to conduct,
by systematic stratagem, an administration
which has been constantly falling in vigour
and energy. If any infraction is left unnoticed
by the party it concerns, and the
article of a treaty, in its modified state, is
once applied with success to any case to
which it may relate, it becomes a precedent
which the Porte will obstinately refer to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>at any other time that the strict interpretation
of the article is insisted upon.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus, without assigning any satisfactory
reason, and without repealing, in a plausible
manner, the Wallachian law of election, the
Sultan took to himself the exclusive right
of appointing to the two Voïvodates. The
measure was not opposed, and its repetition
became habitual; and if, at the present
moment, the inhabitants of the two Principalities
were to recall their right to memory,
and claim the enforcement of it, the Porte
would consider and treat the proceeding as
open rebellion on their part.</p>

<p class='c007'>No prince of Wallachian or Moldavian
birth or origin, was ever appointed after
the recall of Bessarabba, and the Porte
would have been willing to govern the
principalities through the means of Turkish
Pashahs; but the intrigues of the state-interpreter,
Alexander Marrocordato, who
was then endeavouring to secure either of
the Voïvodates to his son Nicholas, induced
at the time the Ottoman government to
introduce another system, which subsequent
motives have contributed to support
to the present day. The Porte selected the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>new princes from the Greeks of Constantinople,
whose long habit of obedience and
servile degradation, appeared to render
them suitable tools for the new policy
adopted, relative to the government of the
principalities. From that moment the
princes have been appointed by <em>Beratt</em>, an
imperial diploma, in which the Sultan, in
proclaiming the nominations, commands
the Wallachian and Moldavian nations to
acknowledge and obey the bearers of it,
as sole depositories of the sovereign
authority.<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c012'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>They were instructed to pursue the plan,
of administration of the Voïvodes, and thus
they were suffered to hold a court, to confer
dignities and titles of nobility, and to keep
up a show of sovereign splendour, circumstances
which were most flattering to the
vanity of the Greeks, and proved useful to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>the interested views of the Porte. But they
were most strictly forbidden to maintain
troops, or to collect any, under any pretence
whatever. This precaution was indispensable,
as it prevented the princes from
acquiring military power, and the natives
from aspiring to independency.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the course of the last century, a variety
of Greek princes succeeded to each other
in the government of the principalities.
One alone, Constantine Marrocordato, appointed
in 1735 to Wallachia, devoted
himself with zeal to the welfare of the
country. Some wise institutions, to which
we shall have occasion to advert in the
sequel, attest the liberality of his views, and
a generosity of character which is not to be
traced in any of his successors. But he was
twice recalled, because he refused to comply
with demands of the Ottoman government,
which appeared to him incompatible with
duties he owed to the Wallachians. The
other princes, less scrupulous, and more
careful of their own interests, marked their
administration by the most violent acts of
extortion, and an invariable system of
spoliation. Few of them died of natural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>death, and the Turkish scymetar was, perhaps,
frequently employed with justice
among them. In a political point of view,
the short reigns of most of these princes
offer nothing of sufficient importance or
interest to deserve a place in history.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>The princes of Wallachia and Moldavia,
since the choice of them falls on the Greeks,
receive their investiture at the Porte, with
the pomp and ceremonies usually observed
on creating <em>Pashahs</em> and <em>Veziers</em>. The
<em>Kukka</em>, or military crest, is put on their
heads by the <em>Muzhur Aga</em>, and the robe of
honour is put on them by the Vezier himself.
They are honoured with the standards
and military music, and make their oaths
of allegiance in the presence of the Sultan,
to whom they are introduced with the ceremonies
usual at a public audience. From
the seraglio, they go in solemn and ostentatious
procession to the patriarchal church,
where prayers and ceremonies are performed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>similar to those which were formerly
observed at the inauguration of the Greek
Emperors. They are accompanied to their
principalities by the Turkish officers appointed
to install them. They make their
public entry into the capital of their new
sovereignty with a great display of magnificence,
attended by the metropolitan and
dignified ecclesiastics, the members of the
divan, and the chief Boyars. They assume,
from the ceremonies which are practised,
the title of “God’s Anointed.”<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c012'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The general form of government in both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>principalities has undergone little alteration
since the exclusion of the native Voïvodes.
The prince is invested with absolute authority,
and, till lately, was only controllable
in his financial operations, by the divan,
representing the senate; still, in levying
extraordinary contributions, and in fixing
the mode of raising them, the signatures of
a majority of members are required as a
mere formality; and, although the want of
these would render such acts illegal, they
would not thereby be put with less vigour
into execution.</p>

<p class='c007'>The executive administration is divided
into various regular departments. The
divan, composed of twelve members, is the
supreme council, and is presided by the
Prince, who appoints to it new members
every year, with the exception of the metropolitan,
whose ecclesiastical dignity entitles
him to a permanent seat. It is convened
at least twice a week, to receive, examine,
and decide upon appeals in judiciary
matters.</p>

<p class='c007'>A Voïvode of the name of Mathew
Bessarabba, who governed Wallachia from
1633 to 1644, instituted laws which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>drew from Justinian’s code, and modified
by the customs of the country. His example
was soon after followed in Moldavia.
Several princes made alterations in the
original codes, and the late princes, Caradja
of Wallachia, and Callimacki of Moldavia,
have made them undergo a new revision,
and have published them under their own
names.<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c012'><sup>[19]</sup></a> It is in conformity to these laws
that all suits are said to be judged, and the
sentences framed; but the prince interprets
them in his own way, and his will, in fact,
is the only predominating law.</p>

<p class='c007'>The princes’ decisions are without appeal
for the natives of the country; and, however
irregular or unjust they may be, they
cannot be revoked by their successors.</p>

<p class='c007'>In any case of moment, where the opinion
of the members of the divan happens
to be unanimous against that of the prince,
or contrary to his wishes, the decision of
the question is postponed, and the members
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>are privately desired to pronounce according
to the views of the prince. As they
are aware that non-compliance would be
attended with dismissal and disgrace, it is
common enough, on similar occasions, that
at the next sessions they all declare an
opinion directly opposite to the one they
had last given.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Bukorest, and at Yassi, where the
princes reside, there are two particular
tribunals appropriated to the revision of
commercial and other differences existing
between the natives and foreign subjects.
They are called the Foreign Departments,
and are each directed by a Boyar, who has
the title of chancellor of foreign affairs, and
two other judges. The business that comes
before them is examined and discussed in
the presence of an officer attached to the
consulate, by which the foreign party concerned
is protected. The decisions are,
conformably to the general sense of the
treaties existing between the Porte and
foreign powers, made according to the local
laws; but they are not valid without the
prince’s confirmation, which can be withheld,
and a timely appeal made either to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>the Grand Vezier’s tribunal at Constantinople,
or to the prince’s own judgement,
should the nature of the department’s decision
bear the appearance of partiality or
injustice against the foreign party. Cases
of this nature are so common, that the
consuls are frequently obliged to act the
part of attorneys in defending the rights of
the individuals who are entitled to their
protection.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are also separate departments for
the police, the treasury, and criminal cases,
as well as a variety of petty offices for the
different business, most of which report
directly to the prince, and receive his
instructions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following is an exact list of the chief
dignitaries, and the other officers of state,
according to their respective ranks and precedence,
beginning with the twelve members
of the divan.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>The Metropolitan</em>, or archbishop.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>The Banno</em>, a title taken from the former

<p class='c007'><em>Logothett de Obichëy</em>; his particular business
consists in assembling the divan.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Vornik de Couttee</em>, or treasurer for the
pensions of the widows of poor Boyars.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Vornik de Polittia</em>, or collector of the
capitation tax within the city of Bukorest.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Clutshiar</em>, or keeper of the code of laws.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Clutshiar d’Aria</em>; although he has a seat,
he is not allowed to vote. He is a kind of
sergeant-at-arms.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to old custom, an individual,
who is not born or naturalised a Wallachian
or Moldavian, cannot be admitted
member of the divan.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>The first Postelnik</em> is principal minister
and master of the ceremonies at court.
His office is of the most confidential nature,
and only given to Greeks, near relations,
or intimate friends of the prince.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>The Spathar</em>; his office formerly corresponded
to that of minister at war. At
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>present he is director-general of the police
throughout the principality. In Moldavia
he is more properly called <em>Hetman</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>The Vestiar</em>, or treasurer of the principality:
he must be a native.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>The Hetman</em>; in Wallachia his business
consists in carrying into execution the
prince’s sentences in matters of judicature.
He takes 10 <em>per cent.</em> on the value of the
objects to which they relate.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Camarash</em>, or first chamberlain; the
prince’s private treasurer, and judge over
the Jews. He levies a duty upon all merchandise
sold by retail for his own profit.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Armash</em>, or judge of criminal causes relating
to the lower orders; he has the
superintendency of the public prisons, and
collects the tribute paid by the gypsies to
government.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Agga</em>, or chief of the police within the
city of Bukorest.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Portar-Bashi</em>; he directs the correspondence
with the neighbouring Turkish Pashahs,
and other governors. He also attends upon
all the Turks of distinction who visit
Bukorest.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>All the preceding offices give the rank
of Boyars of the First Class to the persons
who are appointed to them, and as such
they wear their beards; they are all removed
every year; but as they retain the
titles until promotion, those in activity are
distinguished from them by the additional
one of “<em>great</em>,”—“<em>maray</em>,”—such as <em>Logothett-maray</em>,
the Great Chancellor, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Boyars of the Second Class are as
follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Caminar</em>, or collector of duties upon
wine, brandy, tobacco, and snuff, brought
to Bukorest for sale.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Paharnik</em>, or cup-bearer. At state dinners
he stands behind the prince’s chair,
and offers him to drink.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Comisso</em>, or master of the horse.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Stolnik</em>, chief steward at court.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Sardar</em>, chief or colonel of the guards.</p>

<p class='c007'>Third Class:—</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Medelnitsher</em>; he receives the petitions
addressed to the Hospodars, and reads all
the papers at the divan.</p>

equipages.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span><em>Sludgier</em>; he was formerly commissary to

</table>

<p class='c007'>The renewal of public officers every year
naturally creates great confusion in the
transaction of public business. The custom
arises from the circumstance that the
Boyars, whose number in Wallachia
amounts to nearly thirty thousand, claim
public employment, at least, for a time, as
a right to which they are each entitled.
The first families, in particular, consider it
as their birthright; but as their chief
object is gain, they scramble for places
with the most indecorous avidity, and
never regard their want of capacity for any
branch of public service.</p>

<p class='c007'>As every Boyar has some title or other,
he is never addressed by his name in common
intercourse, but by his title preceded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>by the ancient Greek one of “<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄρχον</span>,” such
as “Archon-Banno, Archon-Shatrar,” &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>A certain ceremony is practised at court
upon all promotions and nominations. It
takes place once or twice every month,
when the prince, seated on an elevated
throne, verbally notifies to the candidate,
who is introduced by the First Postelnik,
the rank or office to which he raises him.
A robe of honour is then placed on his
shoulders, and he advances in the most
respectful attitude, and kisses the prince’s
hand. He is then conveyed home in one
of the state-carriages, or on one of the
prince’s horses (according to his new rank)
and accompanied by a great number of
Chiohadars, or livery-servants of the court,
to whom he pays a considerable fee.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Boyars of the First Class look upon
their titles as corresponding to those of
Count and Baron in Germany, and their
rank to that of Major-general in Russia.
It is true that the Empress Catherine, at
the period of her first war with Turkey,
issued an Ukase to that effect; but her successors
have set it aside. Although most
of the principal families indulge the idea
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>that none in Europe can boast of more
genuine nobility, there are very few who
can trace their origin any farther than a
century back.<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c012'><sup>[20]</sup></a> The present descendants
of Bessarabba and Cantacuzene are amongst
this number. A family in Wallachia bear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>the name of Paleologos, and confidently
assert being descended from the race of the
last Constantine. It would not be very
material to attempt to refute such pretensions;
few could be imposed upon by
them. They appear, however, the more
absurd, as the persons who make them cannot
in any manner explain upon what
grounds they are assumed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wallachia is divided into seventeen districts,
including the Bannat of Crayova
composed of five. They are called <em>Rimnik</em>,
<em>Buzéo</em>, <em>Sakoyéni</em>, <em>Prahova</em>, <em>Yallomitza</em>, <em>Ilfov</em>,
<em>Dimbovitza</em>, <em>Vlaska</em>, <em>Telly-Orman</em>, <em>Mousstzello</em>,
<em>Argis</em>, <em>Olt</em>, <em>Romanatz</em>, <em>Vultza</em>, <em>Doltz</em>,
<em>Gorge</em>, <em>Méhédintz</em>. Each of them is
governed by two <em>Ispravniks</em> or deputies,
whose appointment is renewed every year
by the prince. Their business chiefly consists
in collecting the tribute and other contributions,
which they send to the <em>Vestiary</em>,
from which they are in a great measure
dependent. The <em>Ispravniks</em> of the Bannat
are under the immediate orders of a lieutenant
of the prince, who resides at Crayova,
under the title of <em>Caïmacam</em>. The
Greek princes have substituted this appointment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>to that of the <em>Banns</em>, taking the title
from that of the Turkish minister who fills
the office of the Grand Vezier at Constantinople
during the latter’s absence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The situation of <em>Caïmacam</em> at Crayova is
very lucrative, and generally given to some
of the Greeks who follow the princes into
Wallachia with the hope of enriching
themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Ispravnicates are also given to persons
of that description, jointly with the
sons of Boyars, who, at a very early age,
commonly make their <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">début</span></i> in public
career by those appointments. They receive
a salary of five hundred piasters per
month, besides which they have perquisites,
which, in some of the richest districts, they
extend as far as twenty thousand piasters
a year.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <span class='large'>POPULATION.—TRIBUTE AND TAXES.—OTHER BRANCHES OF REVENUE.—METROPOLITAN DIGNITY.—MONASTERIES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>The exact number of population in the
two principalities has never been properly
ascertained; but the nearest calculation
approaches to one million of souls in Wallachia,
and five hundred thousand in Moldavia,
since the last peace of Bukorest.</p>

<p class='c007'>This population is, in each principality,
divided into three distinct classes; the
Boyars, or nobles, of the different orders;
the tradesmen of all descriptions; and the
peasants, with others, who are liable to the
common taxes and contributions.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the male peasants are, by their birth,
subject to the capitation tax, from the age
of sixteen; with the exception of some few
who compose a privileged body called
<em>Sokotelniki</em>, they are divided into associations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>called <em>Loods</em>, each of which is composed
of a certain number of individuals,
from five to ten, according to their
respective means, and pays a fixed sum of
six hundred piasters every year to the
prince. According to the registers of the
Wallachian Vestiary in 1818, the total of
the <em>loods</em> in the seventeen districts,
amounted to eighteen thousand, which, at
the rate of six hundred piasters, gave an
annual income of 10,800,000 piasters.<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c012'><sup>[21]</sup></a> This
amount of revenue is considered as becoming
the property of the reigning prince, and
not as due by the inhabitants to the Ottoman
government, as some writers have
represented.</p>

<p class='c007'>The treaties made by Mahomet II. and
Suleÿman I. in leaving to Wallachia and to
Moldavia the power of choosing their own
princes, bound these alone to pay an
annual tribute; the amount of it was at
different periods increased; but it is now
fixed at two millions of piasters for Wallachia,
and one million for Moldavia. The
Porte has indeed broken its original engagements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>by assuming the exclusive right
of giving to those countries Greek princes
instead of their own; but in doing so, the
Ottoman court did not degrade the character
of sovereignty inherent in the native
Voïvodes; and if the present princes did
not bear that character, their decisions
would not be, as they are, without appeal
for the natives.</p>

<p class='c007'>The policy of the Porte, and the precarious
position of the Greek Hospodars,
have, however, for a long time rendered the
fixed amount of the tribute due to the
Porte merely nominal; and it is perfectly
understood that the latter, on receiving
their appointments, engage to satisfy any
calls of the Turkish government, of money
and other necessaries.</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides the <em>loods</em>, there are in Wallachia
about one hundred thousand individuals,
and a proportionable number in Moldavia,
who do not belong to the class of peasants,
but who pay taxes at an equal rate. These
are the tradesmen, Ottoman Jews, and
other Rayahs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The privileged class called <em>Sokotelniki</em> is
composed of fifteen thousand individuals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>taken from among the peasantry, and who
were, till lately, perfectly exempted from
every kind of contribution levied by
government; but within a few years the
greater number of them have been made
liable to an annual capitation tax of twenty
piasters each.</p>

<p class='c007'>Their institution dates its origin from a
remarkable reform made by Constantine
Mavrocordato, in 1736, when he had the
government of both principalities at the
same time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Until that period, most of the peasants
were slaves of the Boyars: Mavrocordato
abolished the system, and no attempt was
ever made since to renew it. In order,
however, to indemnify in some measure
the Boyars for the loss of their slaves, he
regulated that each should be allowed to
exact from a limited number of his peasants
an annual tribute, in any shape whatever;
and that this class of peasants, to
whom he gave the name of Sokotelniki,
should be entirely exempted from the burthen
of public imposts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every Boyar of the first rank is now entitled
to eighty Sokotelniki, each of whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>pays him the annual sum of eighty piasters;
some few, instead of receiving money, employ
their Sokotelniki in the cultivation of
their lands, and thus derive a much greater
advantage from them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The privilege, however, is not hereditary
either with the possessors, or the private
tributary. Every rank had a fixed number;
and by the inattention and neglect of
many princes, as well as by the unceasing
increase of titles of nobility, the Sokotelniki
became so numerous, that in 1814 the
government in Wallachia determined to
allow no longer to private individuals a
considerable amount of revenue which
could be appropriated to its own use. A
new law was therefore made, which formed
into government-loods all Sokotelniki who
were not attached to the first class of
Boyars. The institution of this law was
warmly supported by the members of the
divan, who, with their equals, had no loss
to apprehend; but it created great discontent
in all the other classes affected by it,
and particularly with the Boyars of Crayova,
who being more given to agricultural
occupations than the other land-proprietors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>derived great advantage from the employment
of their Sokotelniki; and they unanimously
determined to oppose the new
regulation, as far as it related to themselves;
they threatened to complain to the
Porte through the channel of the Pashah
of Widdin, who appeared willing to second
their representations with all his influence.
The ferocious Haffiz-Alli<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c012'><sup>[22]</sup></a> had at that time
the government of Widdin; and as he was
the prince’s personal enemy, he would have
profited with eagerness of any opportunity
to do him injury. The prince therefore
modified the law relating to Sokotelniki,
and those of the Bannat of Crayova were
excluded from it. The following year he
succeeded in compelling them to submit to
a tax of twenty piasters each.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another privileged class exists in both
principalities, and is called <em>Poslujniki</em>; its
number, however, is far inferior, and it is
composed of some of the foreign peasants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>who come from Bulgaria, Servia, and Transylvania,
to settle in the principalities.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Poslujniki are given to the Greek
Boyars, and to foreign residents of distinction;
a custom which has become habitual
since upwards of fifty years. They pay no
money to the persons to whom they are
attached; but it is their business to supply
them with provisions of wood, barley, hay,
poultry, eggs, butter, and game, in consideration
of which they are exempted
from government imposts, and receive
some protection from their chiefs when
they experience any vexations from the
Ispravniks, or their subalterns.</p>

<p class='c007'>Constantine Mavrocordato did not include
the gypsies in the abolition of
slavery; we shall place our remarks on
this curious people in a more appropriate
chapter.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the last peace concluded at Bukorest
between Russia and the Porte, it was stipulated
that, in consideration of the two
principalities having borne all the weight
of the war, they should not, during the
first two years after the day of their restitution,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>pay any tribute. The agreement
was in the sequel merely observed with
regard to the lood-system, through which
it had been always customary before the
war to collect the imposts; and, under a
variety of other forms and denominations,
contributions were paid to the Ottoman
authorities of an amount proportionable to
the present rates.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most important regular revenues of
the princes, after the <em>loods</em>, are derived from,
the following branches:—</p>

<p class='c007'>The administration of these branches of
government is always sold to private speculators;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>and the above-specified sums have
been paid by them in advance the last six
years. Some merchants, and others possessed
of considerable fortunes in the country,
have acquired their riches by these speculations.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Wallachia it has become customary
that most of the public officers give a share
of their profits to the prince, who, according
to the estimate of their amount, receives
it in anticipation; the whole together, with
the value of the presents made to him on
conferring titles of nobility, secure to him
a private income of about two millions of
piasters.</p>

<p class='c007'>The metropolitan dignity, and all other
sees, are in his gift. The former is usually
granted for life, or for the time of the giver’s
reign. Its revenues amount to four hundred
thousand piasters. They are derived from
landed property bequeathed to the metropoly
by deceased boyars and others, and
from an annual capitation tax of fifteen
piasters levied on the priests of the lower
order, whose number amounts to fifteen
thousand. The claims of the prince on this
important revenue are not so openly avowed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>as on the civil offices; but they are understood
with the person who is raised to the
situation, or is confirmed in it by the successor.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bishops of Argis, Rimnik, and
Buzéo, are the next ecclesiastical dignitaries
in rank, and the only qualified candidates
for the metropoly among their numerous
colleagues. They reside at Bukorest, and
they form the supreme council of the church
under the presidency of the archbishop.
This council is the most corrupted tribunal
of any in the country, and its acts and decisions,
which proceed from any motives than
those of moral tendency, would seem calculated
for no other purpose than the encouragement
of profligacy, and other disorders
in the society. The will of the metropolitan,
or that of the prince, is the
only rule by which its concerns are conducted.</p>

<p class='c007'>The constitution of Moldavia does not
permit the prince to interfere with the
affairs of the ecclesiastical council, nor with
the financial concerns of the metropoly. The
archbishop is elected by the nobility, and
must be a native. The bishop of Romano,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>next in rank, is usually chosen to that dignity.
The same regulations ought to exist
in Wallachia, but a series of abuses have
there rendered many evils irremediable.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both principalities abound with monasteries
originally established by different
Voïvodes, and it was a long time customary
with the inhabitants to consider as great
acts of piety bequests of lands, houses, shops,
or sums of money, made to them, insomuch
that hardly any rich man died without
having allotted a portion of his property
to such a purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>These voluntary gifts had so accumulated,
and the value of land has so increased, that
some of the monasteries are now the richest
establishments in the country. The greater
number are in the gift of the reigning
princes, who let them out for a space of time
to the highest bidders. Others, being dedicated
to the patriarchs of Constantinople
and Jerusalem, are disposed of by them;
but although the princes cannot appropriate
to their own profit any part of their
revenues, as they have the right of imposing
taxes on them upon certain occasions, they
frequently put them under contribution.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Besides the various important branches
of revenue hitherto specified, the reigning
princes possess many other means of raising
money. The two principalities are an inexhaustible
source of riches to them, and their
proverbial appellation of ‘Peru of the Greeks’
is verified by experience.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <span class='large'>GOLD AND SILVER MINES, &amp;c.—PRODUCTIONS.—RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR EXPORTATION.—NAVIGATION OF THE DANUBE.—TRADE OF IMPORTATION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>The chain of Carpathian mountains which
separates the two principalities from the
Austrian dominions, abounds in a variety of
minerals. Gold, silver, quicksilver, iron,
copper, pitch, sulphur, and coals, are
to be traced in many places; but although
there is strong reason to believe they
exist in abundance, no attempt is made
to render them available, and this neglect
is attributed to various motives, some
of which would appear sufficiently justifiable.<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c012'><sup>[23]</sup></a>
The inhabitants maintain, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>to undertake a work of a similar magnitude,
the employment of a considerable capital
and of a great number of men would be requisite,
and consequently the country would
have to support many heavy burthens long
before it would begin to reap any advantage
from their intended object; and that even
after consenting to any necessary sacrifices,
as the fruits of them would only serve to
benefit the coffers of the Grand Signior, it
is thought prudent to abstain altogether
from creating so powerful an attraction to
the leaders of the system of rapacity already
too prevalent in the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>On another hand, it is supposed that the
precarious position of the Greek Hospodars,
who live under the incessant apprehension
of sudden recall and disgrace, induces them
to bestow their whole attention to such resources
only as are most immediately within
their reach, and to neglect any plan that
merely offers a remote prospect of gain.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Porte then seems to be the only
party much interested in this affair, as the
only one capable of setting it properly on
foot, and reaping a lasting advantage. Yet
the Turks evince the same indifference, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>political reasons are given in explanation,
which, however, are by no means satisfactory;
for surely no such considerations
could prevent them from availing themselves
of treasures which they have certainly
assumed in every way the right of calling
their own.</p>

<p class='c007'>From all these conjectures, however, this
conclusion can be drawn,—that as long as
the principalities remain under Turkish influence,
their mineralogic riches will be
buried in obscurity and oblivion. The
rivers Dimbovitza and Argis, taking their
sources in the Carpathians, and crossing
Wallachia to fall into the Danube, carry
along a considerable quantity of grains of
gold. The gypsies that belong to government
are employed in picking them out of
the sand when the waters are low; and they
are allowed to pay their tribute partly from
the fruits of this labour.</p>

<p class='c007'>The trade of Wallachia and Moldavia,
notwithstanding that it labours under a
variety of restrictions and partial prohibitions,
is one of their most important
sources of opulence. Its details are little
known, and less noticed beyond the neighbouring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>countries, although they are by no
means deserving of inattention.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the common productions of the soil,
the most abundant is wheat, of which the
two principalities are supposed to give an
annual return of ten millions of killows,<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c012'><sup>[24]</sup></a>
although hardly one-sixth part of their extensive
and fertile plains is cultivated, and
that a certain space of this is sown by
Indian corn, barley, and hemp.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other productions, proportionably
important in a commercial point of view,
are the bees-wax, honey, butter, cheese,
hides, timber, staves, and ship-masts of all
sizes and descriptions; and an annual supply
of five hundred thousand hare-skins,
six hundred thousand okes<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c012'><sup>[25]</sup></a> of yellow-berries,
and forty thousand kintals<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c012'><sup>[26]</sup></a> of
sheep’s wool.</p>

<p class='c007'>The three last-mentioned articles are
alone perfectly free of exportation; the
remainder are kept at the disposal of the
Turkish government; and it is only in times
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>of abundance, after the usual supplies have
been fixed upon for the granaries and
arsenal of Constantinople, that leave can
be obtained to employ in foreign trade any
portion of them. The exportation of wheat
alone is considered as under a permanent
prohibition; it is not in the power of the
Hospodars to suffer any of it to be taken
out of the country on private speculation;
they must be authorised so to do by Ferman,
a permit which is never granted to Rayahs,
and very seldom to other Europeans, as the
foreign ministers accredited at the Porte,
aware of the difficulty of obtaining it, and
the value that the Ottoman government
would set in the gift of it, prefer abstaining
altogether from applications on the subject,
more especially as their success would only
be profitable to some individuals, without
being productive of any permanent good to
the trade at large.</p>

<p class='c007'>The quality of the Wallachian wheat is
inferior, but it is far from being bad; that
of Moldavia is better, and not differing
much from the Polish wheat. Their ordinary
price stands between 2 and 2½ piasters
per killow. As an article of general trade,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>the charges upon it from the Danube to
Constantinople, would hardly amount to
one piaster more. The Turkish government
send their own ships every year to
transport their share of it, which is each
time fixed at 1,500,000 killows, as well as
the other articles necessary to their use,
the quantity of which is not fixed, though
generally very considerable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Moldavian timber is far better than
that of Wallachia; it is of the finest oak,
and perfectly well calculated for the construction
of vessels. A great number of
ships in the Turkish fleet are built of it,
and fitted out with masts and ropes of
Moldavian growth and origin. In the two
provinces, these articles are sold at the
lowest possible prices, and indeed the same
thing may be said of all the prohibited
articles; which, restricted as they are, from
the monopoly arrogated by the Porte, have
but little demand, except for the local consumption.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hare-skins commonly stand at 35
paras<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c012'><sup>[27]</sup></a> each, in large purchases, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>yellow-berries may be had at 40 or 45
paras per oke. The usual method of
securing any quantity of these two articles
at the lowest prices, is by bespeaking them
at the different villages, and paying something
in advance; the villagers engaged in
such contracts never fail to fulfil them in
proper time.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hare-skins are of the first quality,
but the yellow-berries are inferior to those
of Smyrna, and only demanded when the
crops in Asia Minor have proved deficient.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sheep’s wool is considered to be very
good: cleaned and washed, it is sold at
about 60 paras per oke, or 66 piasters per
kintal, when in its original state, it is offered
at 35 to 40 paras.</p>

<p class='c007'>The principalities abound also in cattle
and poultry of all descriptions. Every year
they supply Constantinople with 250,000
sheep, and 3000 horses. They send, besides,
a great number of these, and oxen, into the
surrounding provinces, where they are
usually sold at great profit.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the productions and commodities
that are employed for the exigencies of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Ottoman capital, are bought by the local
government for about one-fourth of the
prices current in the market, and one-sixth
of their value in Turkey. They are paid
for by a deduction from the common tribute,
and, sometimes, by an extraordinary imposition
of an amount equal to their cost.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before we proceed to any remarks on the
import trade, it is necessary we should say
a few words on the town and harbour of
Galatz, which may be called the seaport of
the two principalities.</p>

<p class='c007'>Galatz is in Moldavia, but nearly touches
the frontier of Wallachia: it is situated at
the beginning of the broadest and deepest
part of the Danube, distant sixty miles from
the Black Sea, sixty-five from Yassi, and
seventy-two from Bukorest. The river is
so far very navigable for ships not exceeding
three hundred tons burthen. Its principal
entrance from the sea is not very easy to
make, owing to the islands which divide
it into three great channels, two of which
are very shallow and dangerous. But ships
bound hither take pilots on board, and
with this precaution, very few accidents
take place, particularly in the fine season.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>The navigation of the Danube closes in
the month of November; and in the severest
winters, even this part of the river is completely
frozen over for the space of five or
six weeks. In the month of March, ships
begin to make their appearance again, and
as they have not the inconveniency of a tide
against them, they are enabled to come up
close to the wharfs, and to remain there until
their business is finished.</p>

<p class='c007'>Galatz is the great market for the produce
of the two principalities, and the only
landing-place for some principal articles of
importation. Having all the resources of
a seaport, it is apparently a very flourishing
town. Its market is always well stocked with
the productions of the interior. The timber,
masts, and staves are conveyed to it along
the small rivers, that come from various parts
of the country, and fall into the Danube
nearest to it. There are public granaries
for the wheat, and a great number of large
warehouses, belonging to private merchants,
for all articles. It is chiefly inhabited by
commercial men, who, notwithstanding the
rigour of the prohibitive measures, often
find the means of exporting some quantity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>of wheat, and other contraband articles;
but their principal trade is that of importation.
The town and its dependencies are
governed by two deputies of the Prince of
Moldavia, called <em>Percalabi</em>. The number
of the fixed inhabitants does not exceed
seven thousand, but the great concourse of
people occasioned every year by commercial
pursuits, gives it the appearance of
being very populous, and all the bustle of
a place of great trade. The presence, in
particular, of a great number of commercial
vessels, increases considerably that
appearance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although Galatz is the general <em>depôt</em> for
many goods of importation, it is not the
principal market for them: they are conveyed
to those of Bukorest and Yassi.
Coffee, sugar, pepper, rum, lemons, oranges,
and foreign wines, are the principal articles
of this description. The local consumption
of the first, in both provinces, is calculated
at 800,000 okes every year; of the second,
900,000 okes; and of the third 35,000 okes;
that of the others is merely eventual.
Their importation, however, surpasses this
quantity, and might be still carried to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>greater extent, as the provinces of Galicia,
Boukovina, Transylvania, Temesvar, and
Servia are partly supplied with those
articles by the markets of Bukorest, Yassi,
and Galatz.</p>

<p class='c007'>The general system of this import trade
is ill contrived, and it is subject to many
inconveniencies. The purchasers have
recourse to the markets of Smyrna and
Constantinople, where, of course, they buy
at high prices. The goods, which have
already paid custom-house duty in Turkey,
are taxed with a new duty of the same kind,
of three per cent., on being landed or
brought into the principalities, as well as
with other charges of an arbitrary nature,
which amount to as much more. The latter
are not, indeed, established by the local
governments, but merely exacted by their
officers, and as they are tolerated, they
become unavoidable, unless the proprietors
of the goods happen to be subjects of
European courts, and as such, receive protection
and assistance from the consuls
residing in the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wallachia and Moldavia are at present
supplied by Germany with all kinds of cotton
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>and woollen manufactures and hardware,
either by land or by the Danube.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plain and printed calicoes, the chintz,
glass and earthenware, brought to their
markets, are, without exception, German;
but they are called English, and as such
sold at higher prices than they would fetch
were their origin made known.</p>

<p class='c007'>The consumption of the woollen cloths
is very extensive; that of the superfine qualities
alone is valued at 200,000<em>l.</em> sterling
every year. Some French cloths are
brought into the country, but as their
prices are considerably higher than those
of Germany, they do not meet with much
demand. French cambrics and English
muslins are always profitable articles to
speculators, and never remain long on
hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>As furs of all kinds form a part of the
national costume, and are, besides necessary,
owing to the natural rigour of the
climate, they are an article of vast importation.
Russia supplies the principalities
with it, and takes in return brandy and
wine, and imperial ducats.</p>

<p class='c007'>Most of the merchants carrying on trade
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>in these countries, are natives, or Greeks.
Some have been naturalised in Russia or
in Austria, and receive protection from
those powers; an advantage which is of no
small consequence to their affairs. Of late
years, some natives of the Ionian islands
have began to trade in the principalities,
and the English flag, borne by their vessels,
is now frequently displayed on the Danube.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some overland expeditions of goods
coming from Smyrna, are now and then
made by way of Enos and Adrianople; but
they are attended with risk and difficulty;
besides which, the amount of charges surpasses
by eight per cent. those incurred by
way of Galatz.</p>

<p class='c007'>The natural richness, and the various
resources of Wallachia and Moldavia, are
such, that if those countries could enjoy the
important advantages of a regular government
and a wise administration, under which
industry and agriculture should receive
their due encouragement, the trade of exports
laid open, the commercial intercourse
with foreign nations set upon a proper
footing, and finally, the mines explored,
they would in a short time become the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>most populous and most flourishing provinces
of Europe. The harbour of Galatz
would soon stand in rivalship with all the
ports of the Black Sea, not excepting
Odessa.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fertility of the soil is such as to
procure nourishment for ten times the
number of the present population, and
leave wherewith to supply other countries
besides; the common return of cultivation
being sixteen-fold, and in more favourable
seasons, twenty-five.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nature has furnished them with every
possible means of becoming prosperous;
men have ever proved themselves the
determined enemies of their prosperity.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <span class='large'>BUKOREST AND TIRGOVIST, THE CAPITALS OF WALLACHIA.—YASSI, THE CAPITAL OF MOLDAVIA.—A DESCRIPTION OF THEM.—MODE OF TRAVELLING.—BREED OF HORSES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>Bukorest, the present capital of Wallachia,
is an extensive dirty town, situated on a
low and marshy ground, and containing
eighty thousand inhabitants, three hundred
and sixty-six churches, twenty monasteries,
and thirty large <i><span lang="sv" xml:lang="sv">hanns</span></i> or caravanserays.</p>

<p class='c007'>About four hundred years back it was
but a small village, belonging to a person
called <em>Bukor</em>, from whom it derived its
name, and retains it to the present day.
By degrees it became a town, and it continued
increasing, until it surpassed the
former capital, Tirgovist, in size. The
Voïvode, Constantine Bessarabba, made it
in 1698, the permanent seat of government;
abandoning with all his nobles the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>city of Tirgovist, most delightfully situated
further in the interior, having on one side
a beautiful range of hills, and the other a
very fine and extensive plain.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Greek princes having continued to
reside at Bukorest, probably on account of
its being nearer to the Turks, Tirgovist
was by degrees deserted by the remaining
part of its inhabitants, and it is now reduced
to a mere village. It contains many ruins
of ancient edifices, amongst which those of
the Voïvodes’ palace are the most conspicuous.
The river Dimbovitza runs alongside
of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yassi,the capital of Moldavia, is a smaller
but better-built town, containing many
elegant houses built in the most modern
style of European architecture, forty thousand
inhabitants, and seventy churches.
One part of it stands upon a fine hill, and
the other is situated in a valley. The
prince’s palace is the most extensive edifice
in the whole town, and is surrounded by
gardens and yards. It is furnished in a
style which is half Oriental and half European,
and has room enough to lodge
conveniently more than a thousand people.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>The palace of Bukorest was formerly a
large building, standing on an eminence at
one extremity of the town, and commanding
a full view of it. In 1813 it was accidentally
burnt down, and it has not been
rebuilt. The late prince had, since that
time, resided in two private houses joined
into one.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both capitals occupy a great extent of
ground, the houses being separate from
each other, and surrounded by yards or
gardens, and trees. All the buildings are
made of brick, and their walls, outside as
well as within, are plastered and whitewashed.
Tiles are seldom used, and the
roofs are generally covered with wood.</p>

<p class='c007'>The streets of the two capitals, and
indeed of all the provincial towns, are,
without exception, paved with thick pieces
of timber, thrown across, and made tight
to each other. In some, the surface is
made smooth and even, whilst in others,
the logs of wood are almost left in their
natural state. In the rainy seasons they
are constantly covered over with a deep
liquid mud, and in the summer, with a
thick black dust, which the least wind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>renders excessively injurious to the eyes
and lungs; besides these great inconveniences,
a complete renewal, at least
once in every six years, is absolutely
necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Bukorest, under the wooden pavements,
to which the natives give the more
appropriate name of <em>bridges</em>, there are large
kennels, which receive the filth of the
houses, and are meant to convey it to the
river Dimbovitza, which runs through the
town. Hardly any care is taken to keep
the different passages open, and the accumulation
of dirty substances frequently stops
them up; in this state they sometimes
remain for months in the hot season, during
which they produce the most noxious
exhalations, and occasion fevers of a putrid
and malignant nature,—diseases to which
the natural position of the town must alone
dispose a great part of the inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been long supposed, and it is still
considered impossible to pave the streets
with stone, not so much on account of the
scarcity of the material, as owing to the
ground being of a soft clay, which offers no
hold to it. This idea, very prevalent among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>the natives, is certainly erroneous, and
there cannot exist a more convincing
proof of it, than the stone pavements
constructed by Trajan and the Romans,
which have so firmly withstood the destructive
hand of time.</p>

<p class='c007'>From a certain distance, and on elevated
ground, the city of Bukorest offers itself to
the view with great advantage; the mixture
of the houses and trees give it a peculiar
beauty; but it is like the fine scenery
of a theatre which charms the distant eye,
and on being approached is found to be a
coarse daub.</p>

<p class='c007'>As late as thirty years back, the Boyars
were in the habit of visiting each other,
and going to court on horseback, and the
women of the most opulent only, went in
coaches. Within that period, the fashion
of riding in coaches has so increased, and
it is now so universal, that no person of
either sex, who has claims to respectability,
can pass the gates of his house otherwise
than in a coach, even in the finest weather.
The Boyars consider it derogatory to their
dignity to make use of their legs, and leave
to the mob the vulgar practice of walking.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>The consequence is, that the streets, about
seven or eight yards wide, are always full of
carriages, and frequent accidents happen to
the unfortunate pedestrians.</p>

<p class='c007'>The kind of carriage most in use, is the
German calèche; and the Boyars have
introduced the fashion of having theirs
ornamented in the most gaudy manner;
but as they do not so much regard the
beauty of the horses and harness, nor the
dress of the coachman, it is very common
to meet in the streets a carriage glittering
with gold, drawn by a pair of miserable
hacks, and driven by a gypsy in rags.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are many coachmakers, both at
Bukorest and at Yassi; but the carriages
sent from Vienna are preferred to theirs,
and much higher prices are paid for them.
The Boyars are indifferent as to their
solidity, and buy any old vehicle that is
made up to deceive the eye, and is offered
as new; fine ornaments being the only
quality in estimation, every twelve or
eighteen months they are obliged to purchase
a new carriage. On another hand,
their own inattention, and the lazy, slovenly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>and careless habits of their coachmen,
render this annual expense indispensable.</p>

<p class='c007'>No coaches of any kind are to be hired,
so that travellers, and other non-residents,
must submit to the necessity of going on
foot. Private lodgings are also seldom to
be had, and it was but very lately that a
public hotel was set up at Bukorest, which,
being well furnished, and provided with
every requisite commodity, has become
very useful to travellers. A German is the
proprietor and director of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mode of travelling in the two principalities
is so expeditious, that in this respect
it is not equalled in any other country.
Their post establishments are well organized;
there are post-houses in all directions,
and they are abundantly provided
with horses. Every idea of comfort must,
however, be set aside by those who are
willing to conform themselves to the
common method of riding post. A kind
of a vehicle is given, which is not unlike a
very small crate for earthenware, fastened
to four small wheels, by the means of
wooden pegs, and altogether not higher
than a common wheel-barrow. It is filled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>with straw, and the traveller sits in the
middle of it, keeping the upper part of his
body in an erect posture, and finding great
difficulty to cram his legs within. Four
horses are attached to it by cords, which
form the whole harness; and, driven by one
postilion on horseback, they set off at full
speed, and neither stop nor slacken their
pace, until they reach the next post-house.
Within the distance of half a mile from it,
the postilion gives warning of his approach
by a repeated and great cracking of his
whip, so that, by the time of arrival,
another cart is got ready to receive the
traveller.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Boyars, and other people of respectability
in the country, travel in their own
carriages, and at their own pace. In winter,
as the snow lies about two months on the
ground, sledges are generally used, as well
in town as in the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Wallachian breed of horses is of a
peculiar kind. Their stature is very small,
and they have no spirit; but they are strong,
active, and capable of enduring great
fatigue. Those of Moldavia differ only in
being a little larger in size. Some of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>richest people have their horses sent them
from Russia and Hungary; but they are
merely meant for their coaches, as, from
an aversion to every exercise that occasions
the least fatigue, hardly any of them ride
on horseback. Handsome saddle-horses,
consequently, are seldom seen in the country;
the prince is the only person who
keeps any; but they are chiefly used by his
Albanians, or body-guard.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>None of the events that had influenced
the political existence, and undermined the
public spirit of the Wallachian and Moldavian
nations, proved more ruinous to them
than the system of policy introduced by the
Greeks of the Fannar<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c012'><sup>[28]</sup></a>, when they were
placed at the head of the principalities.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>Humiliated, degraded, and oppressed as
the Greeks were, since they had ceased to
be a nation, civilisation degenerated among
them, in proportion to the weight and barbarism
of the yoke that had been imposed
on them, and they had insensibly contracted
those habits of corruption, and
servile obedience, which must be inseparable
from a state of slavery similar to
theirs. Dissimulation and falsehood became
the most prominent features of their character;
and, in short, the force of the causes
which acted upon them incessantly, familiarised
them, by degrees, to every thing
that could be degrading and humiliating to
man.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ambition of certain Greeks, leading
an obscure life at Constantinople, was,
however roused, when the office of state-interpreter
at the Porte, assumed an important
appearance under the direction of
their countryman, Alexander Mavrocordato,
who, from a petty merchant at the island
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>of Scio, rose by degrees to that station, and
was sent in the quality of Ottoman plenipotentiary
to the congress of Carlowitz, where
he distinguished himself as an able negotiator.
He caused his son Nicholas to be
raised to the governments of Moldavia and
Wallachia, and he suggested to the Porte
a new mode of appointment to those principalities,
after the elective right had been
entirely set aside. The Ottoman court
thenceforward appropriated those two dignities
to individuals who had once served
in the quality of state-interpreter to its
satisfaction, not so much as a reward for
their services, as on account of the knowledge
obtained of their personal character
and extent of abilities.</p>

<p class='c007'>On another hand, the repeated demonstrations
of servitude on the part of the
Greeks, and the apparent impossibility of
their ever becoming a nation again, seemed
to render them the fittest tools of the
Porte’s new system of government in the
principalities; for, although it could not
trample upon the whole of their privileges
at once, yet, in giving them princes who
should be entirely devoted to its interests,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>and slaves to its will, the existence of those
privileges was rendered nugatory.</p>

<p class='c007'>No sooner was the possibility of sharing
in the public administration manifested to
the Greeks, than such as were versed in
the Turkish and European languages, abandoning
all other pursuits, formed themselves
into a distinct class, which assumed
the title of nobility, and the exclusive
right of being called to the service of the
state.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a short time, however, the number of
competitors increased considerably; all
equally eager and impatient to reach the
same objects, they introduced a system of
intrigue and bribery, which gave rise to
continual changes in the government of
the principalities, and accustomed the Porte
to look upon these as farms which were to
be let out to the highest bidders; the
farmer-princes were therefore deposed and
recalled, whenever the offers and promises
of others of their countrymen appeared
more advantageous.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the period at which this system
was introduced, to the beginning of the
present century, being a space of ninety
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>years, Wallachia alone has passed through
the hands of forty different princes, independently
of the time it was occupied by
the Russians, from 1770 to 1774; by the
Austrians and Russians, from 1789 to
1792, and by the Russians again, from
1806 to 1812.</p>

<p class='c007'>The evils which naturally arose from such
a state of things, weighed so heavily upon
the two nations, that the court of Russia,
already authorised by the treaty of Kaïnargik<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c012'><sup>[29]</sup></a>,
to interfere in their behalf, insisted
at the peace of Yassi in 1792, that the
Porte should engage to maintain the
princes of Moldavia and Wallachia in their
respective stations, for the space of seven
years, and not to molest them in any
manner previous to the expiration of that
term. This agreement was then legally
entered into by the Ottoman plenipotentiaries,
but in the sequel it was not
regularly observed by the Porte, whose
frequent infractions of it became the subject
of continual remonstrance on the part of
the court of Russia. In 1802, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>Prince Ipsilanti was appointed to the government
of Wallachia, and Prince Alexander
Mourousi to that of Moldavia, with
the express condition which was obtained
through the negotiations of the Russian
minister at the Porte, that neither of them
should be removed from office previous to
the term stipulated in the treaty, if they
were not proved guilty of an offence that
the Russian minister should allow to be of
a nature which justified their deposition.<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c012'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In 1805, the intrigues of Buonaparte,
who sought to involve Turkey in his continental
system, prevailed upon the Porte to
adopt a line of conduct which Russia could
not otherwise interpret, than as a systematic
violation of its existing engagements, and
an approaching alliance with France, notwithstanding
that a public audience of the
Sultan was given to the Russian envoy,
Mr. d’Italinsky, in which a formal exchange
of ratifications took place of a late treaty of
defensive alliance concluded between the
two powers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Hospodars, Ipsilanti and Mourousi,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>were suddenly recalled, without the participation
of the Russian embassy; the latter
was replaced by Charles Callimacki, and
the former by Alexander Sutzo, a man who
was looked upon as a partisan of Buonaparte,
and who had always been obnoxious
to the interests of Russia.</p>

<p class='c007'>Previous to this circumstance, a certain
degree of coolness already existed between
the courts of St. Petersburgh and Constantinople;
it originated in the Porte’s sudden
resolution of suppressing foreign protections,
in abolishing all letters-patent, until
then granted to individuals, natives of
Turkey, who were authorised by such
letters to place themselves under the protection
of foreign courts, although residing
and trading in the Ottoman dominions.
More particularly in carrying that resolution
into effect, by forcibly and publicly
compelling all such individuals, protected
by Russia, to give up their titles, without
paying the least regard to the representations
of the Russian embassy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ipsilanti’s and Mourousi’s deposition
brought things to a crisis. A Russian army
was immediately sent to the frontiers to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>enforce the treaties, and having occupied
the fortresses of Bender and Hotim, the
Porte looked upon the measure as a declaration
of war, and the Mufti issued his
<em>Fetvaa</em><a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c012'><sup>[31]</sup></a>, which declared it legal to repel
force by force.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rupture was soon followed by another
with England, who had joined Russia to
oppose the increasing influence of Buonaparte
over the Porte. When, in 1805, the
English ambassador, Mr. Charles Arbuthnot,
arrived at Constantinople, the Porte
expressed a wish of renewing the treaty of
accession made in 1799, the term of which
(eight years) was drawing to its end. That
treaty, framed upon the wisest principles,
completed the triple alliance between England,
Russia, and Turkey, from which so
many important advantages have accrued to
the common cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Arbuthnot not being invested with
full powers for that particular object, wrote
home for instructions, and received them a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>short time after; and when on their arrival
an offer was made to the Turkish ministers
to commence the work, they very unexpectedly
began to draw back, and an actual
recantation took place, which naturally
created the greatest surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>The intrigues of the French ambassador,
and Buonaparte’s progressive encroachments
in Europe, had made on the minds
of the Sultan and his ministers such an
impression, that no remonstrance, no
threat could now induce them to perform
what they themselves had shown so much
wish for before.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, the British embassy
could not remain indifferent to the recall
of the Hospodars, and to the manner in
which the foreign protections had been
suppressed.</p>

<p class='c007'>From an impulse of official regard to the
complaints and interests of those individuals
who were patentees under the
English protection, and in consequence of
the Russian envoy’s solicitations that their
efforts might be joined for the purpose of
resisting the violent measures pursued by
the Turkish government, the British ambassador
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>made many representations to the
Porte against its proceedings, and although
impartial in principle as to the practice of
granting protection to natives of the country,
he, at all events, recommended moderation,
and a less offensive mode of carrying
the new system into execution. But
having soon discovered and ascertained
beyond a doubt, that all interference was of
no avail, that the resolution of the Turkish
cabinet was such as to hazard all, sooner
than withdraw from the adopted plan, he
deemed it expedient to advise the British
patentees to proceed, as if from their own
accord, and give up their titles to the Porte,
and in the mean time recommended in a
private manner, the property and personal
safety of such individuals, who, by this
means, not only avoided the resentment of
the Turkish government, but were all well
treated, and some taken into favour.</p>

<p class='c007'>The British ambassador, however, showed
less disposition to compliance with regard
to the other proceedings of the Porte, and
having insisted with Russia on the immediate
reinstatement of the Hospodars
Ipsilanti and Mourousi, the subject was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>discussed at the divan, where the general
opinion inclined to a firm resistance of those
pretensions; but the Sultan finally declared,
that however humiliating might be
the alternative of ceding to them, he was
resolved to recur to it rather than break
with England.</p>

<p class='c007'>This decision was at the time carried
into execution, to the extreme disappointment
of the French ambassador, Sebastiani,
whose great object was to kindle the fire he
had raised. But very soon after, advices
being received that the Russian troops had
already entered the Moldavian territory,
affairs underwent a total change; the Russian
envoy was dismissed, and the Grand
Vezier took the field.</p>

<p class='c007'>To represent these events in a more
proper point of view, it is necessary to
observe, that it was neither the intention of
England, nor the wish of Russia, to engage
in a serious war with Turkey. Their object
was to bring the Porte to a sense of its true
interests, in diverting it from a line of conduct
which bore every appearance of a
change in its political system, and was every
way calculated to confirm the suspicion that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>the Sultan was contracting an alliance with
Buonaparte.</p>

<p class='c007'>In order to separate the Porte from the
French party, and induce it to return to
the connexions which had formerly existed
with the allies of Turkey, a plan of coercive
measures had been found necessary; and, to
give them a greater weight, it had been
determined that Russia should send an army
from the north, and England a fleet from
the south.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the English fleet appeared before
Constantinople, it naturally occasioned the
greatest confusion and alarm. The Sultan
lost no time in sending on board to offer
terms of peace, and negotiations were commenced
with Mr. Arbuthnot, who was in the
flag-ship, the Royal Sovereign. But they
were carried on with much less vigour than it
was necessary to give them, and left time to
the French intrigues to gain the advantage.
Buonaparte’s active agents, General Sebastiani
and Franchini<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c012'><sup>[32]</sup></a>, were the more anxious
to counteract the operations of the English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>plenipotentiary, as they were aware that the
first result of his success would have been
the expulsion of the French embassy from
Constantinople. They employed for that
purpose every means in their power, and
they succeeded by the following stratagem.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chief of the Janissaries, Pehlivan-Aga,
had formerly been colonel of a regiment,
which had acted once as guard of
honour, given to a French embassy at the
Porte. Having remained some time in that
station, he had contracted a lasting connexion
with the French, to whose party,
since that period, he devoted himself.
When General Sebastiani saw that peace
with England was on the point of being
concluded, he sent Franchini to him to
suggest a plan which the Turkish officer
carried into immediate execution. He
went to the seraglio<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c012'><sup>[33]</sup></a>, as if in great haste,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>and having obtained audience of the Sultan,
he thus addressed his imperial chief:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“May God preserve your sacred person
and the Ottoman empire from every possible
evil. A pure sense of duty brings
me before your Royal Person, to represent
that so strong and general a fermentation
has arisen amongst my Janissaries since
the appearance of the infidel’s fleet before
your royal palace: they express so great
a discontent at the measures pursued by
your ministers in negotiating with the
English, from a shameful fear that the
appearance of that fleet has thrown them
into; that a general insurrection is on
the point of breaking out, unless the
negotiations be laid aside, and all offers
of peace be rejected with scorn. They
declare that it is beneath the dignity and
fame of the Ottoman empire, to submit
to such an act of humiliation, as to sign
a treaty, because a few ships have come
to bully its capital, and dictate their own
terms to the Ottoman sovereign. Your
brave Janissaries will not suffer so disgraceful
a stain to tarnish the splendour
of the Ottoman arms. They are all ready
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>to sacrifice themselves in defence of your
residence, and in vindication of the honour
and faith of the Ottoman nation. But
they can never consent to stand tacit witnesses
of a submission so ignominious to
the Turkish name.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sultan Selim, a prince naturally timid
and credulous, no sooner heard a message
of this sort delivered in the name of the
Janissaries, then in good understanding
with the chiefs of government, and apparently
united with the troops of the
Nisam-y-gedid<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c012'><sup>[34]</sup></a>, than he ordered all communications
with the English fleet to be
suspended, and immediate preparations of
defence to be made, in the event of its
commencing hostilities.</p>

<p class='c007'>This manœuvre, unknown at the time,
and with which very few persons are yet
acquainted, was the true cause of the failure
of the negotiations which, at the commencement,
bore so sure a prospect of
success.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fleet returned without even having
made a show of hostile intentions, and left
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>to the triumphant French party the most
decided influence in the Seraglio.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before we enter into further observations
on the events which followed, it
may not be amiss to make a few remarks
on the character of those who were then at
the head of the Turkish administration, as
it is to them that the whole change of system
of the Porte is to be attributed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Haffiz-Ismaïl Pashah, Grand Vezier, appointed
early in 1805, was a low-bred,
ignorant man, so poor and thirsty after
money, that the moment he was elevated
to his station, he formed the plan of
operating a change in the principalities of
Wallachia and Moldavia, although the time
prescribed by the treaties was not yet near,
with a view of getting a subsidy, and
securing to himself an income which the
candidates, who took no small advantage
of the Vezier’s inexperience and selfish
views, had promised to allow him when the
appointment should have taken place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ibraïm-Aga, Kiaya-Béÿ, or minister of
the interior, a man of little experience and
great ambition, under the idea of ingratiating
himself with his master, and rendering,
as he thought, a signal service to the state,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>undertook the affair of protections which
he treated in a manner so insulting and
provoking, that it was impossible for any
foreign power, jealous of its own dignity,
to suffer it to remain unnoticed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Mufti, Sheriff-Zaadé-Attaa-Effendi,
and the chief of the Janissaries, Pehlivan-Mehmet Aga,
were entirely devoted to the
French party. They willingly seconded
the adoption of any measures which tended
to alienate the Porte from England and
Russia, and appeared calculated to promote
Buonaparte’s scheme of overthrowing the
triple alliance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Galib Reïs-Effendi, minister of foreign
affairs, and Yussuf-Aga, Validay-Kiayassi
or chancellor to the Emperor’s mother,
were the only two men in power friendly
to the common cause. They disapproved
of the measures pursued, but their opinion
was over-ruled, and they both thought it
prudent to retire from business, in order to
screen themselves from responsibility with
respect to the consequences they foresaw.</p>

<p class='c007'>The military operations on the Danube be
between the Russians and the Turks, which
followed the first acts of hostility, were not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>more successful with regard to the object
that brought them on, than the threats of
the English fleet.</p>

<p class='c007'>The peace of Tilsit took place; and the
Porte, which had reason to expect an effective
interference on the part of Buonaparte
in behalf of its differences with Russia,
gained no other advantage than the conclusion
of a long armistice, the first condition
of which was the retreat of the Russian
armies from the principalities, whence,
however, they did not remove. Negotiations
for peace were, notwithstanding, set
on foot; and the great revolutions, which
overthrew the Sultan Selim, and consigned
him to death, finally established a new
order of things at Constantinople, and
operated a complete change in the political
system of the Turkish cabinet. The Porte
remained no longer blind to the equivocal
conduct of Buonaparte since his reconciliation
with Russia, and began to look upon
its state of hostility with England not only
as useless, but even injurious to the interests
of the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1808, an English<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c012'><sup>[35]</sup></a>plenipotentiary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>had been for the second time<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c012'><sup>[36]</sup></a> sent to treat
at the Dardanelles, and peace was definitively
signed in the month of December of
the same year.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the same time the Turkish plenipotentiaries,
sent to Bukorest during the
armistice, were endeavouring to adjust the
differences with Russia; but the interview
of the Emperor Alexander with Buonaparte
took place at Erfurth, and the
failure of their joint proposals to the court
of London<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c012'><sup>[37]</sup></a> was followed by instructions to
Prince Prosoroffsky, commander-in-chief of
the Russian armies in Moldavia and Wallachia,
to signify to the Ottoman plenipotentiaries
that, as the Emperor Alexander
had acceded to the Continental System, the
chief object of which was a continual state
of warfare with England, he could no longer
enter upon terms of peace with Turkey,
unless the English ambassador, lately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>admitted at Constantinople, were sent out
of the Ottoman dominions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Turkish ministers expressed astonishment
at the versatility of the court of
Russia, which, having made the first overtures
for a negotiation, had not then in any
manner alluded to England; they demanded
time, however, for the arrival of instructions
which were necessary to regulate their
official reply to a communication so unexpected.
They dispatched a messenger to
Constantinople for that purpose, and he was
accompanied by an aide-de-camp of Prince
Prosoroffsky, Colonel Bock, who, on his
arrival, signified to the Porte the Emperor’s
ultimatum, through the channel of the
French minister Latour Maubourg.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Ottoman government, without much
hesitation, recalled the Turkish plenipotentiaries
from the congress of Bukorest, and
hostilities were renewed.</p>

<p class='c007'>A plan of partition had been formed at
Erfurth between the emperors Alexander
and Napoleon, by which the Turkish provinces
were to fall to the share of Russia,
and Spain to that of France. It was after
this understanding between the two sovereigns
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>that overtures were made to England.
The English negotiation took time, and
before it came to a decided issue, Buonaparte
declared to his senate that the principalities
of Wallachia and Moldavia were
annexed to the dominions of his friend and
ally the Emperor Alexander. When, however,
Buonaparte found England determined
to treat upon no basis which did not expressly
admit of the evacuation of Spain,
and that by entering into such terms he left
a decided advantage to Russia with respect
to Turkey, without reaping any benefit to
himself from the political bargain made at
Erfurth, he changed his views. The continental
system, which he endeavoured to
justify in attributing the general calamities
of Europe to a tyrannical perseverance in
war on the part of England, furnished him
with a sufficient pretext for engaging Russia
to continue her war against Turkey, who
had just entered into terms of friendship
with England. On the other hand, he prevailed
upon the Turkish government to
insist on the restitution of the principalities
occupied by the Russian armies, and to
continue hostilities so long as the Russian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>court should withhold its consent to that
measure. His desire of keeping these two
powers at variance with each other could
not but increase when he had subsequently
formed the plan of invading Russia, who,
molested on one side by the Turks, and on
the other by the Persians, was thus forced
to employ considerable armies on distant
frontiers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The exhausted state of Turkey, the mediation
of England, and the impatience of
Russia, who was pressed by the hostile preparations
of France, evidently intended
against her, hastened the conclusion of peace
in 1812 between the Mussulman powers
and the Russians; but, critical as the circumstances
were, the Court of St. Petersburgh
signed a most advantageous treaty
with both.</p>

<p class='c007'>Galib Effendi, who, since the great changes
of government at Constantinople, had resumed
the functions of minister of foreign
affairs, was chief plenipotentiary at the congress
of Bukorest in 1811 and 1812; but
the Greek prince Demetrius Mourousi, who,
in his quality of state-interpreter, was present
at the negotiations, conducted the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>greatest part of them, and was indeed intrusted
with extensive power. He had, with
his two brothers, been invariably attached
to the Russian party since the beginning of
his public career, and his hopes of being appointed
to one of the principalities, the
greatest objects of his ambition, after the
restoration of peace, appeared grounded
upon the best foundation. His office, his
services at the congress, and the support of
the court of Russia, were, in fact, considerations
which appeared to render his nomination
certain.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cession of Wallachia and Moldavia
could not, therefore, by any means, suit his
views, and he combated it with energy and
success; but, in rendering so important a
service to the Porte, some proof of attachment
to Russia was also necessary on his
part; and although by insisting on the entire
restitution of the principalities, no doubt
but the Russian plenipotentiaries, who were
instructed to hasten the conclusion of peace
upon any terms not beyond that restitution,
would have consented without hesitation,
Mourousi, who was aware of it, finally settled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>the conditions by ceding to Russia the
finest part of Moldavia, that which is
situated between the rivers Dniester and
Pruth, thus fixing the future line of demarcation
of the Russian frontiers by the
direction of the latter river.</p>

<p class='c007'>The vigilant agents of Buonaparte at
Constantinople did not suffer the conduct
of Mourousi to remain unnoticed. When,
after the signing of the treaty, they saw
themselves frustrated in the hope of inducing
the Porte to continue the war, they
sought to bring the Mourousi family into
disgrace, that they might, at least, prevail
upon the Ottoman government to place at
the head of the principalities persons of
their own choosing. They represented the
Prince Demetrius as a traitor who had been
bribed by the Russians to serve their interests,
at a time when it was in his power
to obtain the most advantageous terms of
peace.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile hostilities commenced between
France and Russia, and the Porte
having evinced a resolution of remaining
neutral, unwilling to give umbrage to either
of the contending powers in the choice of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>the new Hospodars, resolved to fix upon two
individuals whose political principles had
never been connected with foreign parties.
A great number of candidates offered their
services, but none of them being qualified
for the appointments, their claims were
rejected. Halett-Effendi, intimate counsellor
of the sultan, was instructed to make
a choice, and he fixed it on the prince
Charles Callimacki<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c012'><sup>[38]</sup></a> for Moldavia, and
Yanco Caradja for Wallachia. Halett-Effendi
had been several years before
Turkish secretary to Callimacki’s father,
whilst at the head of the Moldavian government,
and on terms of intimate friendship
with Caradja, who had also a subaltern employment
under the same prince. Being
perfectly acquainted with the personal character
of both, he recommended them to the
sultan as the fittest persons in those circumstances,
and they were appointed in
August 1812.</p>

<p class='c007'>Demetrius Mourousi, who, with Galib
Effendi, had not yet departed from Wallachia,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>received the news of the nominations
at a time that he expected with confidence
that of his own. He was at the same time
secretly informed that his return to Constantinople
would expose him to the greatest
dangers, and advised to retire into a Christian
country. Offers were made him of an asylum
in Russia, with a considerable pension from
the government; but, fearful that his flight
might direct the vengeance of the Porte on
his family, who had remained in the power
of the Turks, and in the hope of justifying
his conduct, since the whole responsibility
of the transactions at the congress ought
properly to have fallen on Galib Effendi, he
made up his mind to accompany that minister
back to the capital. He little suspected,
however, that the Turkish minister, whose
conduct had been disapproved of, had removed
every unfavourable impression relative
to himself from the mind of the Sultan,
by attributing the conditions of peace to
which he had subscribed, to the intrigues
and treachery of Mourousi; and that he
had, in consequence, received secret orders
to arrest the Greek prince the moment they
crossed the Danube together, and send him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>prisoner to the Grand Vezier, who had not
yet removed his head-quarters from Shumla.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mourousi, still more encouraged by the
friendly assurances of Galib Effendi, left
Bukorest in September, and from Rustehiuk
was conveyed under an escort to Shumla,
where, on entering the gates of the Vezier’s
dwelling, he was met by several Chiaoushes<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c012'><sup>[39]</sup></a>
who fell upon him with their sabres and
cut him in pieces. His head was sent to
Constantinople, where it was exposed three
days at the gates of the Seraglio, with that
of his brother Panayotti Mourousi, who,
during the absence of Demetrius had filled
his place at the Porte, and was accused of
having been his accomplice in betraying
the Ottoman interests.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Hospodars Caradja and Callimacki
took possession of their respective governments
on the 3d of October, 1812, the day
fixed for the restitution of the principalities;
and the Porte, whose present security on
the side of Russia, in a great measure depends
on the strictest adherence to its
treaties with that power, has made no attempt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>of removing the princes previous to
the expiration of the seven years.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Hospodar Caradja, however, having
in the course of six years’ residence in
Wallachia, amassed immense wealth, apprehensive
of being called to account on his
return to Constantinople for laying aside so
many riches for his own use, judged it
prudent to make a timely retreat, and to
settle in some Christian country of Europe
beyond the reach of Turkish influence.
He remitted all his money to European
banks, and one day in October, 1818, he
assembled some of the principal Boyars,
consigned to them the reins of government,
and left Bukorest with all his family for
Kronstadt in the Austrian dominions, where
he arrived in safety after a short journey.<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c012'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>After his departure, the Boyars petitioned
the Sultan that he would no longer appoint
Greek princes to govern Wallachia, but
confide the administration to the members
of the divan, who engaged to accept and maintain
any tributary conditions that he would
think proper to prescribe to them. The Ottoman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>cabinet, however, did not conceive it
prudent to listen to the proposal; and after
communicating with the Russian ambassador,
appointed to the principality the same
Alexander Sutzo, who had been so strongly
opposed by the Russian Envoy in 1805.</p>

<p class='c007'>Russia had no longer reasons to object to
his nomination; and no doubt but the
Prince Sutzo, who is an enlightened and
well-thinking statesman, will acquit himself
of his charge as well as the circumstances
in which he is situated, will permit. But
the harassing and ruinous system of government,
still maintained in the principalities,
offers, it must be confessed, no small
matter of regret on the indifference of the
Porte with regard to the adoption of
measures better calculated for their welfare
and prosperity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Ottoman court has often witnessed
the consequences of the dread with which
the Greeks employed in its service are
impressed, and has felt on various occasions
how much its policy must tend to alienate
from the Turks every sentiment of good-will
of the inhabitants of those provinces,
and make them desirous and ready to throw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>themselves into the arms of the first nation
whose armies approach their territory to
make war on Turkey; and yet it continues
in the same system. Greek princes, however
devoted to the interests of the Porte,
would certainly do little without armies, in
the event of an unexpected revolution in
Wallachia and Moldavia. Their presence
alone is by no means sufficient to maintain
in them the Turkish authority. The fortified
places on the Danube, are the only
guarantees of the fidelity of the principalities.
In suffering the two nations to be
governed entirely by their own natural
authorities, would the Ottoman supremacy
incur the least diminution of power? and
would it not continue to maintain the same
commanding advantages?</p>

<p class='c007'>The inattention of the Turkish cabinet
is not to be exclusively ascribed to the general
system of governing the empire, but
chiefly to the selfish views and personal
avidity of the ministers who compose it.
They have accustomed themselves to look
upon Wallachia and Moldavia as two rich
provinces over which they have but a momentary
authority; and, instead of seeking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>the means most calculated to secure a permanent
possession of them, they shorten
the possibility by a systematic devastation
of all their resources.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Sultan himself, who takes a much
more active part in the affairs of state than
many of his predecessors have done; whose
talents and liberal sentiments would claim
equality with those of any other sovereign,
were they not so much restrained by the
religious prejudices and stubborn ignorance
of his Mahometan subjects: and whose chief
attention has of late years been directed to
a new organization of the empire, unfortunately
seems equally averse to any changes
which might tend to improve the condition
of Wallachia and Moldavia.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>The proximity of the Black Sea and of
Mount Hæmus on one side, and that of the
Carpathian Mountains on the other, render
the climate of the principalities variable,
and subject to sudden changes from heat to
cold.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the wind comes from the north-east,
even in the middle of summer, it cools
the atmosphere to such a degree, as to force
the inhabitants to cover themselves with
additional clothing. The southerly wind
brings heat and fine weather; but it seldom
lasts any length of time.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>A great quantity of rain falls during the
summer, and in the months of June and
July it is always accompanied by storms of
wind and thunder, which regularly return
every day at the same hour towards the
evening.</p>

<p class='c007'>The winter is almost always long and
tedious, and the summer heats set in all at
once at the beginning of May, so that the
beauties of a regular spring are little seen or
known.</p>

<p class='c007'>The severest part of the winter begins
early in December, and the same degree of
cold, with little variation, lasts until the
middle of February, when a damp and unhealthy
temperature succeeds, and continues
until May. The Danube and all the
rivers that fall into it from the principalities
generally remain frozen for six
weeks, and the ice is thick enough to bear
with perfect safety the heaviest artillery.
The snow lies on the ground the whole of
January and February, and communications
with every part of the country are carried
on with sledges.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the latter part of September to the
middle, and frequently to the end of, November,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>the days are the finest in the year.
But the nights are excessively cold, and the
night air particularly unwholesome. Travellers
who do not take care to guard
against its influence by flannels and thick
clothing, are exposed to the danger of
various kinds of fevers, and of the pleurisy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The irregularity of climate, the damp
quality of the soil, and an abundance of
marshy places throughout the principalities,
produce a visible influence over the animals
of the various sorts which are common to
them, as well as over the vegetation. The
bears, wolves, and foxes, are of the most
timid nature; hardly any danger is to be
apprehended from them, unless they are
met in numerous flocks, as is common
enough during the coldest winter nights.</p>

<p class='c007'>The domestic animals are also remarkable
for mildness. The beef, pork, mutton,
poultry, and game, have rather an insipid
taste; the vegetables an inferior flavour,
and the flowers little perfume.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, man, the chief work of nature, is
here of a dull and heavy disposition: with
weak passions, no strength of mind, and betraying
a natural aversion to a life of industry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>or of mental exertion. Moral causes
may indeed produce such effects upon the
human frame; but here, those of a physical
kind evidently act in unison with them,
and with equal force.</p>

<p class='c007'>The education of the Boyars is usually
confined to the mere knowledge of reading
and writing the language of the country, and
the modern Greek. Some few add to this
superficial stock of learning, a few of the rudiments
of the French language, which has
been introduced by the Russian officers
among them. Many more understand and
speak it without the least knowledge of its
letters or grammar. If any are able to talk
familiarly, though imperfectly, of one or
two ancient or celebrated authors, or make
a few bad verses that will rhyme, they
assume the title of literati and poets, and
they are looked upon by their astonished
countrymen as endowed with superior
genius and abilities. An early propensity
to learning and literature receives but little
encouragement; and, at a more advanced
period in life, the allurements of public
employment, the petty intrigues at court,
and the absence of every obstacle to pursuits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>of gallantry and pleasure, induce even
the best disposed to set aside every other
occupation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Public schools have, since several years,
been established both at Bukorest and
Yassi. They are supported at public expense,
and attended by masters for the
Wallachian, ancient and modern Greek
languages, writing, and arithmetic. The
number of students at each school amounts
at the present moment to about two hundred.
They are the sons of inferior Boyars
and tradesmen. The children of the principal
Boyars receive their education at home
from private tutors, commonly Greek
priests, who are not natives of the principalities.</p>

<p class='c007'>The education of the women is not more
carefully attended to than that of the men;
sometimes it is inferior, on account of the
prevailing custom of marrying them at a
very early age.</p>

<p class='c007'>Neither sex is regularly instructed in religion,
and it is by the mere intercourse of
life that they derive their notions of it, and
by the examples of their elders that their
principles in it are regulated.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>These circumstances, naturally arising
from the discouragement given by the government
to every improvement in civilisation,
keep the state of society very backward,
and are productive of the most pernicious
influence over its moral character.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Boyars, indeed, although so little
susceptible of great virtues, cannot be taxed
with a determined propensity to vice.
Established prejudices, which the general
state of ignorance has rooted in the two
nations, and a universal system of moral
corruption, render them, however, familiar
with it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Money is their only stimulus; and the
means they generally employ to obtain it
are not the efforts of industry, nor are they
modified by any scruples of conscience.
Habit has made them spoliators; and in a
country where actions of an ignominious
nature are even encouraged, and those of
rapacity looked upon as mere proofs of
dexterity and cunning, corruption of principles
cannot fail to become universal.</p>

<p class='c007'>The prodigality of the Boyars is equal to
their avidity; ostentation governs them in
one manner, and avarice in another. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>are careless of their private affairs, and, with
the exception of a few more prudent than
the generality, they leave them in the
greatest disorder. Averse to the trouble of
conducting their pecuniary concerns, they
entrust them to the hands of stewards, who
take good care to enrich themselves at their
expense, and to their great detriment.
Many have more debts than the value of
their whole property is sufficient to pay;
but their personal credit is not injured by
them, neither do they experience one moment’s
anxiety for such a state of ruin.</p>

<p class='c007'>The quality of nobility protects them
from the pursuits of the creditor; and the
hope of obtaining lucrative employments,
by the revenues of which they may be able
to mend their affairs, sets their minds at
ease, and induces them to continue in extravagance.
Some bring forward their ruin
as a pretext for soliciting frequent employment,
and when the creditors have so often
applied to the prince as to oblige him to
interfere, they represent that the payment of
their debts depends upon his placing them
in office. The office is finally obtained, and
the debts remain unpaid. When a sequester
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>is laid upon their property, they contrive
to prove that it came to them by marriage;
and as the law respects dowries, they save
it from public sale.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Wallachian or Moldavian language
is composed of a corrupt mixture of foreign
words, materially altered from their original
orthography and pronunciation. Its groundwork
is Latin and Slavonic. For many
centuries it had no letters, and the Slavonic
characters were used in public instruments
and epitaphs. The Boyars, whose public
career rendered the knowledge of a few
letters most necessary, knew merely enough
to sign their names. The Bible was only
known by reputation. In 1735, Constantine
Mavrocordato,who had undertaken the
task of replacing barbarism by civilisation
in both principalities, made a grammar for
the jargon that was spoken, in characters
which he drew from the Slavonic and the
Greek. He caused several copies of the
Old and New Testament in the new language
to be distributed, and he ordered the
Gospel to be regularly read in the churches.
He encouraged the inhabitants to study
their language according to the rules of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>grammar, and in a few years the knowledge
of reading and writing became general
among the higher orders.<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c012'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The modern Greek, introduced by the
Hospodars, is the language of the court,
but it is perfectly understood by the Boyars,
with whom it has become a native tongue.
It is spoken in Wallachia with much greater
purity than in any other country where it
is in use. In many parts of Greece, different
dialects have been adopted, some of
which have but little affinity with the Hellenic,
whilst in others the greater part of
the words have been so disfigured as to
render their origin difficult to trace. The
Greek spoken in Wallachia differs but little
from the Hellenic. The Moldavians are
less in the habit of making use of it; and
the study of French and other foreign languages
is more general among them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The national dress of the Boyars does
not differ from that which belongs to the
higher classes of Turks, with the only exception
of the turban, to which they substitute
a kind of cap of an extraordinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>size called <em>calpack</em>, made of grey Astracan
fur, in the shape of a pear. It is hollow,
and the largest part of it is about three feet
in circumference, with a proportionable
height. It is altogether a very ugly and
ridiculous head-dress, and not at all adapted
to the beauty and magnificence of the rest
of the costume.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ladies dress entirely in the European
style; but they combine the fashions with
oriental richness and profusion of ornament.
Their persons, in general, have not
much beauty; but this deficiency is made
up by a great share of natural grace and
pleasant humour, and by a peculiar neatness
of shape.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Wallachian music has some resemblance
with that of the modern Greeks,
although more regular in time, and altogether
more harmonious. Its style has
hardly any variety, and all the tunes are
uniformly played in minor keys. Some
would produce good effect if played with
proper delicacy and expression. The instruments
mostly used are the common
violin, the Pan-pipe, and a kind of guitar
or lute peculiar to the country. The bands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>are composed of these three kinds of instruments,
all of which play the leading
part without variation of accompaniment;
they are only introduced on occasions of
mirth or festivity. The Boyars, being no
admirers of music, never make a study of
it, and their gypsy slaves are the only persons
who profess it. Their women, however,
are partial to the German style of it,
and several of them perform on the pianoforte;
but want of perseverance keeps them
from reaching to any degree of perfection,
and want of emulation from persevering.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dance, formerly common to all the
classes of the natives, and which, at present,
is the only one known to the lower
orders, is of a singular style. Fifteen or
twenty persons of both sexes take each
other by the hands, and, forming a large
circle, they turn round and round again, at
a very slow pace; the men bending their
knees now and then, as if to mark the time
of music, and casting a languishing look on
each side, when holding the hands of
women. This kind of dance has some years
since been thrown out of fashion in the
first circles of society, and English country-dances,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>waltzing, and the Polish mazurka
have been introduced. Most of the ladies
dance them well, but the men very indifferently,
their dress being a great obstacle
to perfection in the accomplishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the daily occupations and pastimes of
the Boyars, little variety takes place. Those
who hold no place under government, spend
their leisure in absolute idleness, or in
visiting each other to kill time. In Wallachia,
the management of their estates and
other private concerns, which do not relate
to public appointment, does not occupy
much of their attention, and sometimes
the finest of their lands are left in total
neglect, or in the hands of mercenary
agents, who enrich themselves with their
spoils. They hardly ever visit their country
possessions, which some let out for several
years, for much less than their real value,
when they find customers who are willing
to pay the whole amount of rent in advance.
They build fine country-houses
which they intend never to inhabit, and
which, in a few years, fall into ruin. The
most delightful spots in their beautiful country
have no power to attract them, neither is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>it at all customary with them to quit the
town residence at any season of the year.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Boyars in Moldavia, like those in
Wallachia, are the great land-proprietors;
but they bestow much more of their attention
and time to the improvement of their
estates, which they make their principal
source of riches. The revenues of some of
the most opulent, from landed property,
amount to two or three hundred thousand
piasters, and their appointment to public
employment is generally unsolicited.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the winter, the chief amusements
of the Boyars at Bukorest consist in attending
public clubs, established on the plan
of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">redoutes</span></i> at Vienna. Masked balls
are given in them three or four times a
week, which attract great numbers of people.
There are, however, clubs adapted
to the different ranks; the principal of
them, to which the court and first Boyars
subscribe, is distinguished by the appellation
of <em>Club-noble</em>; it is very numerously
attended towards the end of the Carnival,
and although its title indicates a perfect
selection of society, it does not the less
allow entrance to people of all descriptions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>under masks. The most genteel do not
dance here, unless they are masked; but
they play at the pharao-table, and at other
games, of which the place offers a variety.</p>

<p class='c007'>Private balls are also given sometimes,
but no other kind of regular evening parties
are customary. Formalities of invitation,
however, are never expected; and the
tables of the Boyars, and their houses, are
at all times open to their friends and acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The summer evenings are generally spent
at a place called <em>Hellesteo</em>. It is a lake
situated about a mile’s distance out of town,
on the borders of which, the company walk
or sit two or three hours. Near the most
frequented part is a coffee-house, where
ices and other refreshments are to be had.
On Sundays, the number of carriages
coming to this place, amounts sometimes to
six or seven hundred; and the multitude
of fashionables, as well as the great display
of dress and jewels of the ladies, certainly
render it a gay and pretty scene. The
walks are not shaded by trees, and the only
advantage they offer, is an extensive view
round the country.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>At the distance of a mile from the
<em>Hellesteo</em>, is situated a beautiful little grove
called <em>Banessa</em>, to which a part of the company
frequently drive. It is the property
of a Boyar of the name of Vakaresko, and
forms a kind of park to his country-house,
situated behind it. This gentleman is not
only good enough to keep it open to the
public, but even makes every possible improvement
for their accommodation, at his
own expense. Both he and his lady do
the honours of it to their friends, in the
most obliging manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the company return to town from
these places at the same time; the line of
calèches, endless to the sight, raise clouds
of dust, to the no small derangement of the
ladies’ toilets. Some spend the remainder
of the evening in riding up and down the
principal streets, and others assemble at
different houses to play at cards.</p>

<p class='c007'>In winter, the afternoon rides are confined
to the streets of the town, where the
number and splendour of sledges is equal to
that of the calèches in the fine season.</p>

<p class='c007'>Last year a company of German actors
came to Bukorest, and after some performances,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>were encouraged to establish a
regular theatre. They gave German operas,
and comedies translated into Wallachian,
and the first two or three months they attracted
crowds from all the classes, who,
without exception, seemed to have taken a
true liking to the new sort of amusement;
but latterly the charm of novelty had begun
to wear off, and the Boyars of the first order,
with some of the principal foreign residents,
seemed to be the only persons disposed to
support the continuance of the establishment,
more with the view of making it a
place of general union of the society, than
from the attractions of the stage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The days of Christmas, new-year, the
prince’s anniversary, Easter, and some
others, are chiefly devoted to etiquette visits
at court. From nine o’clock in the morning
to one in the afternoon, the prince and
princess, seated at the corner of a very long
sopha, and covered with jewels and the
most costly apparel, receive the homage of
all those who are entitled to the honour of
kissing their hands, an honour which the
foreign consuls, their wives, and officers attached
to their suite, alone, think proper to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>dispense with. No other persons residing
in the country can be received at court on
gala days without going through that formality.
The wives of Boyars are allowed
to sit in the presence of the prince and princess;
they take seat according to the rank
or office of their husbands, who without exception
are obliged to stand at a respectful
distance. On similar occasions, the crowd
at court is immense; the whole of the outer
apartments are filled with persons of every
description, and the audience-chamber is
not less so by the number of visitors. On
new-year’s-day it is customary to make presents
of money to the servants attending
the court; they have no other pecuniary allowance
for their services; and the bustle
and confusion occasioned by the avidity of
this crowd of harpies is as difficult to be
described as it is inconsistent with the dignity
of a court who expects and ordains universal
homage to its chiefs.</p>

<p class='c007'>About two hundred and ten days of the
year are holidays, and they are strictly observed
by the inhabitants, as far, at least,
as relates to the exclusion of all kinds of
work. The public offices, although they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>have so great a portion of the year to remain
inactive, are allowed, besides, a fortnight’s
vacation at Easter and during the hottest
days of summer. In these useless and pernicious
days of idleness, whilst the Boyars’
chief occupation consists in seeking the
means of killing time out of their homes,
the lowest classes spend it with their earnings
at the brandy-shops, where prostitutes
are kept for the purpose of attracting a
greater number of customers, and of propagating
with vice the most horrible of all
the diseases with which human nature is
afflicted.</p>

<p class='c007'>The number of this disgraceful class of
females is so great at Bukorest, that the
late Aga, or police director, suggested to
the prince the plan of levying a capitation
tax on each, whereby he would create a new
revenue of some hundred thousand piasters.
This plan, contrary to expectation, was not
put into effect, though it was not likely to
meet with obstacles.</p>

<p class='c007'>The manners of society among the Wallachian
Boyars are not remarkable for refinement.
The general topics of social conversation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>are of the most trivial nature, and
subjects of an indecent kind frequently take
the place of more becoming discourse; they
are seldom discouraged by scruples of any
ladies present.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the habitual state of inaction, brought
on by a natural aversion to every serious
occupation which does not immediately
relate to personal interest, both sexes, enjoying
the most extensive freedom of intercourse
with each other, are easily led to
clandestine connexion; the matrimonial
faith has become merely nominal.</p>

<p class='c007'>Various other customs contribute to the
domestic disorders prevailing in a great
number of private families. Parents never
marry their daughters, to whatever class
they may belong, without allowing them
dowries beyond the proportion of their own
means, and to the great detriment of their
male children, who, finding themselves unprovided
for, look upon marriage as the
means of securing a fortune, and consequently
regard it as a mere matter of pecuniary
speculation. Feelings of affection or
sentiments of esteem are therefore out of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>the question in the pursuit of matrimonial
engagements, and money remains the only
object in view.</p>

<p class='c007'>When a girl has reached the age of thirteen
or fourteen, her parents become anxious
to procure a husband for her. They do not
wait for proposals, but make the first offers,
sometimes to three or four men at a time,
stating with them the amount and nature of
the dowry they are disposed to give. They
enter into a regular negotiation when a
greater amount is required, and finally
settle with him who remains satisfied with
the most reasonable terms. The inclinations
of their daughter are never consulted
on the occasion, and too great a disparity
of age, or other personal defects on the part
of the future husband, never appear to them
objectionable. The girl is sometimes perfectly
unacquainted with the man of her
parents’ choice; and, at her tender age,
unable to form any judgment on the state
of matrimony, she submits to their will
with indifference. Not long after the nuptials,
she is left perfect mistress of her
actions, her domestic affairs are entirely
put into the hands of the servants, and she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>never interferes with them. Neglected by
her husband, and at full liberty to dispose of
her time as she thinks proper, she forms
connexions of intimacy with women more
experienced in the world than herself. The
attractions of pleasure and society become
too strong to be resisted, and the example
of others, with the numerous temptations
that surround her, prove, sooner or later,
fatal to her virtue. To the harmony which
may have subsisted between her and her
husband, succeeds disgust; quarrels soon
follow, and blows sometimes are not spared
on her. Her condition becomes at last intolerable,
she quits her husband’s house,
sues for a divorce, and generally obtains it,
however frivolous the plea in the true sense
of the law. Her fortune is given back to
her, and enables her to live single, or to attract
another husband, if she feels again an
inclination to matrimony. She is now allowed
her own choice of one; but, once accustomed
to the agreeable paths of diversity,
she seldom remains more faithful to the
second than she had been to the first.</p>

<p class='c007'>The church of Wallachia and Moldavia
is the only one professing the Greek religion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>that authorises divorce; or more properly
speaking, the only one that abuses
the power of pronouncing it, the authority
being granted to the patriarch of Constantinople
on occasions of the most particular
nature, and indeed never made use of.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the principalities, the sentence of
divorce is pronounced so frequently, the
motives alleged are sometimes so frivolous,
that it never affects the reputation of a
woman, so as to degrade her in her ordinary
rank of society; nor does it in the
least become a scruple to the delicacy of
the men, whatever may have been the
nature of its motive.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are but few families at Bukorest
who have long continued in an uninterrupted
state of domestic harmony, and
fewer still who can point out some relation
who has not gone through a divorce.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sometime back, a Wallachian lady of
quality, who had brought but a small fortune
to her husband, became desirous of
fixing her residence in one of the principal
streets of the town, and she pressed him to
lay aside his accustomed system of economy,
to sell his estate, the revenue of which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>gave them the principal means of support,
and to build a fine house in that street.
The husband, more reasonable than herself,
positively refused to listen to her extravagant
proposal; and the lady, incensed at
his upbraiding her for it, quitted his house,
and shortly after sued for divorce, which
she obtained. This lady, who has since
remained single, professed great piety, and
is still considered as a very pious woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not long after, a young Boyar, contrary
to custom, fell in love with a very beautiful
young woman, of the same rank and age.
The parents of both agreed on their union,
and the nuptials were celebrated by public
festivities. This couple was looked upon
as the only one in the country whom a
strong and mutual attachment had united.
At the end of the first year the husband
was suddenly attacked by a pulmonary complaint,
and induced by the physicians’ advice
to separate himself for some time from
his wife, and go to Vienna in order to consult
the best medical men. After eighteen
months’ absence, finding himself perfectly
recovered, he hastened back to Bukorest
impatient to see his wife, to whom he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>not ceased to write, but whose letters had
latterly become much less frequent. On his
arrival he found the most unexpected
changes in his family affairs. His wife had
gone to her parents, refused to see him,
and had already consented to marry another!
Her father, who was the chief instigator
of her sudden resolution, had negotiated
the second marriage, because it
suited his own interests.</p>

<p class='c007'>The legitimate husband claimed his
spouse through every possible channel; but
he was not listened to, and government
declined interfering.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sentence of divorce was pronounced
by the metropolitan; and, although the
husband’s refusal to sign the act rendered
it perfectly illegal, the second marriage
took place; the ceremony was performed
by the archbishop in person, and public
rejoicings were made on the occasion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The circumstances of this adventure
were the more remarkable, as the second
husband had been married before, and
divorced his wife after six weeks’ cohabitation,
when he saw the possibility of obtaining
this lady’s hand.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>Another lady of the first rank separated
her daughter from her husband, with whom
she had lived six years, and caused a sentence
of divorce to be pronounced. She
gave for reason, that her daughter’s constitution
suffered considerably by frequent
pregnancy. The husband, who was by no
means inclined to the separation, and who
knew his wife to enjoy the best health,
made remonstrances to no effect: and he
was condemned by government to give back
the dowry, and to pay damages to a considerable
amount, for having spent a part
of it, although he proved to have employed
the deficient sum for the use of his wife
and family.</p>

<p class='c007'>These three instances of the degraded
state of morals in these countries are selected
from numerous others that occur
daily. They are such as to excite astonishment,
and appear almost incredible; yet
they created no other sensation at the time
than other common news of the day, deserving
but little notice.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is customary in Wallachia for parents
to interfere in their married children’s
family concerns, and to exercise nearly the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>same authority over them after marriage as
before. They are often seen as busy in
intriguing to bring on a separation, as they
had been active in seeking husbands or
wives for them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The absurdities of superstition, which
form so great a part of the fundamental
principles of the present Greek faith, have
gained equal strength in Wallachia and in
Moldavia: even the most precise doctrines
of the Christian religion are there corrupted
by the misconceptions or selfish views of
low-bred and ignorant priests, a set of men,
indeed, who have here made themselves a
manifest disgrace to the sanctity of the
Christian name.</p>

<p class='c007'>A celebrated writer has said that ‘Climate
has some influence over men; government
a hundred times more, and religion
still more.’<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c012'><sup>[42]</sup></a> This observation is particularly
applicable to these countries, and its
truth illustrated by their present condition.
Either of the two last-mentioned causes,
separately, would have acted with force
upon the morals of their inhabitants. Intimately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>connected as they are, the evils
that result are most deplorable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mode of instructing the Wallachians
and Moldavians in the precepts of religion,
is not, however, calculated to animate them
with excessive zeal and to propagate fanaticism.
They are merely taught to plunge
headlong into all the ridicules of superstition,
the inseparable attendant of ignorance;
and it is probably owing to the total
absence of fanaticism that the priesthood
exercise a less powerful influence here,
than they do in other Greek countries. All
the ecclesiastical dignitaries being of obscure
origin, and mostly of the lowest extraction,
they are personally despised by the
Boyars. Their spiritual power is alone
respected.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rites ordained by the established
church are the same as those of the patriarchal
church. Persons who have not received
baptism in it, are not considered as
Christians, nor even honoured with the
name of such.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frequency of confession and communion,
and the punctual observance of a vast number
of fast-days, during the year, are prescribed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>with severity. They have become
the most essential points of faith, and the
people believe with confidence that an exact
adherence to them is sufficient to expiate
the heaviest crimes, particularly after the
confessor’s absolution, which, in most cases,
is to be obtained by the means of a good
fee.</p>

<p class='c007'>Attending divine service at a very early
hour on Sundays and other holidays, and
three or four times a day during the week
of the Passion, is also required and observed;
the signs of devotion performed
in it, consist in making crosses and prostrations
before the images, kissing them,
and lighting a candle to some favourite
saint. The Gospel, when read, is heard with
indifference and inattention. Preaching is
not customary.</p>

<p class='c007'>The laws of the church strictly forbid
matrimony between persons who are in any
degree related to each other: they even go
so far as to prevent marriage between people
whose parents may have stood godfathers
to either in baptism. The severity
of the matrimonial laws is still greater with
respect to the difference of religion, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>one of the parties belongs to the Greek
church. A transgression would be followed
by a sentence of divorce, and punished by
excommunication, if the marriage, already
concluded, were persisted in. The dread
of this last evil is so great to all the natives,
that every sacrifice is made in preference of
being exposed to it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The patriarch of Constantinople, although
acknowledged as chief of the religion,
has no controul over the church of
the two principalities and exercises but
little influence over its chief dignitaries.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <span class='large'>PEASANTS—THEIR MANNERS AND MODE OF LIVING.—EMIGRATIONS.—AGRICULTURE.—GENERAL ASPECT OF THE COUNTRY.—AN ACCOUNT OF THE GYPSIES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>There does not perhaps exist a people labouring
under a greater degree of oppression
from the effect of despotic power, and
more heavily burthened with impositions
and taxes, than the peasantry of Wallachia
and Moldavia; nor any who would bear
half their weight with the same patience
and seeming resignation. Accustomed,
however, to that state of servitude which to
others might appear intolerable, they are
unable to form hopes for a better condition;
the habitual depression of their minds has
become a sort of natural stupor and apathy,
which render them equally indifferent to
the enjoyments of life, and insensible to
happiness, as to the pangs of anguish and
affliction.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Hence it is in a great measure inferred
that they are a quiet and harmless people.
Their mode of living is, indeed, with regard
to the intercourse among themselves, an
uninterrupted calm. Although the male
part are given to drinking, quarrels and
fighting are almost unknown among them;
and they are so much used to blows and
all kinds of ill treatment from their superiors,
that they approach with the greatest
respect and submission any who bear upon
themselves the least external mark of
superiority.</p>

<p class='c007'>Their religious notions, grounded upon
the most ridiculous superstition, are extremely
singular. They firmly believe in
all sorts of witchcraft, in apparitions of the
dead, in ghosts, and in all kinds of miracles
performed by the images of saints, and by
the virtues of the holy water. In illness,
they place an image near them, and when
they recover, though it were through the
assistance of the ablest physician, they attribute
their return to health to the good
offices of the image alone. Their observance
of Lent days is so strict, that the threats
of instant death would hardly prevail upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>any one to taste of the aliments specified
in the endless catalogue of forbidden food.
Their other Christian duties, although
similar to those of the superior classes of
their countrymen, are carried to greater
excess. Invoking the Holy Virgin or any
saint, is always substituted to regular
prayer. Divine Providence is never directly
addressed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The villages throughout the country are
principally composed of peasants’ huts,
all built in the same style and of the same
size. The walls are of clay, and the roofs
thatched with straw, neither of which are
calculated to protect the lodgers from the
inclemency of the bad seasons. The groundfloors
are, however, occupied as long as the
weather will permit, and in winter they retire
to cells under ground, easily kept warm
by means of a little fire made of dried
dung and some branches of trees; which,
at the same time, serves for cooking their
scanty food. Each family, however numerous,
sleeps in one of these subterraneous
habitations, men, women, and children, all
heaped up together; and their respective
beds consist of one piece of coarse woollen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>cloth, which serves in the double capacity
of matrass and covering.</p>

<p class='c007'>Their ordinary food is composed of a
kind of dough to which they give the name
of <em>mammalinga</em>, made of the flour of Indian
wheat, sometimes mixed with milk. The
first two or three days after a long Lent, they
sparingly indulge themselves in meat; but
the greater part cannot afford even so great
a treat, and content themselves with eggs
fried in butter, and the milk to their
mammalinga.</p>

<p class='c007'>They continue the whole day out of
doors at work, and they bear with indifference
all the extremes of the weather. Their
industry, however, is not of a very active
kind, and they take frequent rest.</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding this mode of life, and
the supposed influence of an ungenial climate,
the generality of the peasants are a
fine race of people. They have no peculiar
turn of features which may be called characteristic;
from long intercourse with foreign
nations, their blood seems to have become
a mixture of many. The Eastern black eye
and dark hair, the Russian blue eye and
light hair, the Greek and Roman nose, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>those features which distinguish the Tartars,
are equally common amongst all the
orders of these two nations.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both sexes are in the habit of marrying
very young. They are not given by inclination
to sensual pleasures; but as religion
does not teach the women the propriety of
virtue, excessive poverty induces them to
grant their favours for any pecuniary consideration,
frequently with the knowledge
and consent of their husbands, or parents.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the holidays, they spend most of their
time in the village wine-houses, where they
eat and drink, and sometimes dance. At
other times they enjoy the spectacle of
bear-dancing, a very common amusement
throughout the country, conducted by wandering
gypsies, who teach the art to those
animals while very young, and gain a living
by exhibiting them afterwards.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dress of the male peasants bears
some resemblance to that of the Dacians,
as represented in the figures of Trajan’s
pillar at Rome. Their feet are covered
with sandals made of goat-skin. They wear
a kind of loose pantaloon which is fastened
to the waist by a tight leather belt, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>closes from the knee downwards. The
upper part of the garment is composed of a
tight waistcoat, and a short jacket over it,
of coarse cotton stuff, and in winter is added
a white sheep-skin, which is hung over the
shoulders in the manner of an hussar’s
pelisse. The head is not deprived of any
part of its hair, which is twisted round
behind, and a cap is used to cover it, also
made of sheep-skin, but which in summer
is exchanged for a large round hat. The
beard is shaved, and the whiskers alone are
left to their natural growth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The women are clothed from the neck to
the ancles with a long gown of thick cotton
stuff of a light colour, made tight at the
waist in such a manner as to render the
whole shape visible. They generally go
barefooted, and they cover their heads with
a common handkerchief, merely meant to
keep up the hair. On holidays they add
to their common shift a coloured gown of a
better sort: they button it up from the
waist to the neck, round which they wear
as ornament, one or more strings of beads,
or <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">paras</span></i>, pierced through for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since their emancipation, the peasants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>have not been fixed to particular parts of
the country, and they are at full liberty to
change their habitations at the end of their
engagements with the landholders. But
those of a more respectable kind seldom
quit the spots where chance has once placed
them, unless they are driven by imperious
circumstances.</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding the unfortunate position
of this people, by no means enviable to their
neighbours, the miseries of famine in Transylvania
sometimes cause considerable emigrations
of peasants from that vast province
into Wallachia and Moldavia. All the best
lands in Transylvania being in the hands
of Hungarians, Szecklers, and Saxons,
the others who form the bulk of the population
are driven into hilly and barren
situations, where at all times they subsist
with difficulty; and of late years the more
than ordinary scarcity that prevailed has
driven about twenty thousand peasants,
subjects of the emperor, into the dominions
of the Hospodars, where the great disproportion
between the number of agricultural
hands and the extent of arable land, renders
such emigrations extremely useful. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>are placed on the same footing as the native
peasants with regard to tribute.</p>

<p class='c007'>The changes of residence that sometimes
take place among the peasantry are not
detrimental to the collection of the imposts,
as it is the business of the Ispravniks of
each district to ascertain, every six months,
the number and means of the individuals
living within the limits of their Ispravnicates,
and amenable to taxation. The deficiency
of any particular district being made
up by the increase in another, no loss accrues
to the treasury.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no regular system exercised with
respect to the arrangements of the landholders
and peasants. In general, however,
the latter are allowed a share of the produce
in kind, with an understanding that the
burthen of the taxes and impositions falls
upon them; not that the former would be
averse to taking upon themselves the payment
of their tenants’ contributions, but
because government is decidedly against the
introduction of a similar regulation, the
amount and nature of the imposts being
nominally fixed, but always exceeding the
regular rates.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>As the Boyars proprietors of land in
Wallachia never cultivate the estates for
their own account, but merely rent them to
those who can make the greatest offer of
ready money, the less valuable are sometimes
given to the whole body of peasants,
residing in them when the advances are
made by them. The richest estates give
an income of fifty or sixty thousand piasters:
but they are divided and subdivided
for marriage-portions for the proprietors’
daughters; and if the custom continue for
a few generations longer, a system, something
similar to the agrarian law, must be
the future consequence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The manner of tilling the ground does
not materially differ from that of other
countries in Europe; oxen are employed
instead of horses.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wheat is sown during the Autumn;
the barley and Indian corn in Spring. The
harvest of the two first generally takes place
in the month of July; that of the latter at
the beginning of September; and as this
article is required for the nourishment of
so great a portion of the population as the
peasantry, the quantity of it sown and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>reaped every year is equal to that of wheat.
Barley being only made use of for feeding
cattle and poultry, it is sown in a much
smaller proportion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The vine is always planted on the sloping
of hills, and in situations where it can receive
some protection against any sudden
severities of the weather; the grape is seldom
gathered before the end of September;
and as it does not come to a perfect state
of maturity, it makes but indifferent wine,
of a light and sourish taste. All other
kinds of fruit, common to Europe, come
here in great abundance at their usual
seasons.</p>

<p class='c007'>The great waste of land left in both
principalities in a state of nature, and the
universal custom of not cultivating the
immediate vicinity of the high roads, give
to the country, in many parts, an appearance
of desolation; and a traveller, who
only judges by the scenery within his view,
is apt sometimes to think himself in a
wilderness; he meets with few habitations
on his way, except those attached to the
post-houses, and hardly perceives any other
population.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>But of all the sensations of delight produced
by the beauties of nature, none can
surpass that which is raised by the aspect
of the more interior parts of this country.
Romantic hills and dales, rivulets and
streams, fields adorned with verdure and
flowers, present themselves in a successive
variety of beauty during the fine season,
particularly within twenty or thirty miles
of the Carpathians, from the Pruth to the
Danube at Orsova. The inner parts of
those mountains themselves offer the most
magnificent scenery; and their summits,
the most beautiful and extensive views.
Those who have seen the romantic parts of
the Alps, cannot help recalling them here
to their remembrance; the impressions of
the moment are such that they feel at a loss
to decide which deserve the preference.
Whilst the impatient courier, going over
the rough roads through the Carpathians,
bestows curses on the dangers that slacken
his pace, and impede his progress, the
voluntary traveller and lover of nature
stands lost in admiration, and finally quits
with reluctance and regret scenes which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>nature has formed in her most romantic
mood.</p>

<p class='c007'>The aspect of the Carpathians is very
different in winter: all the heights are
covered with snow, and the narrow roads
with mud and large stones, rolled in the
midst of them by the torrents, so as to
render them almost impassable; mostly
situated on the brinks of dreadful precipices,
at the bottom of which rivers or
torrents have formed their passage, one false
step of the passenger is immediate death.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Hospodars purposely neglect to
repair these roads; the fear of creating
suspicions at the Porte that they wish to
facilitate the passage of foreign troops into
the principalities, induces them to abstain
from an undertaking, which in other respects
has become so imperiously necessary:
they do not even venture the slightest
representation to the Porte on the subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>Few peasants inhabit this part of the
country; during the summer they cut
down wood, and supply with it the inhabitants
of the plains, who burn nothing else.
The most stationary are attached to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>post-houses, situated here and there for the
purpose of assisting the necessary communications
between the Austrian and Ottoman
states. Their long residence in this
neighbourhood is generally marked by the
glandular accretion, common to the inhabitants
of the Alps. It grows sometimes to
an immense size; its appearance is then
most disgusting, and it absorbs almost all
the faculties, moral and physical, of the
unfortunate beings afflicted with it. The
natives believe the cause of this evil to proceed
from the qualities of the snow-water
always drunk by those who inhabit the
mountains.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every village throughout the country
has a small church or chapel belonging to
it, and one or more priests who act as
curates. The ecclesiastics of this order are
chosen amongst the ordinary peasants, from
whom they are only distinguished in appearance
by a long beard. They lead the
same life, and follow the same avocations
when not engaged in the exercise of their
clerical functions; but they are exempted
from the public imposts, and pay nothing
more than their annual tribute of fifteen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>piasters to the metropolitan. The generality
of them can neither read nor write;
they learn the formule of the service by
heart; and if a book is seen in their
chapels, it is very seldom for use. The
priests of this order are, in each district,
dependent on the <em>Archimandrites</em>, or Vicars,
of the parishes nearest to their abode.</p>

<hr class='c019' />

<p class='c007'>That class of the human species comprehended
under the general appellation of
gypsies, seems to be, like the Jews, spread
in most parts of Europe, and in many other
parts of the world; like them having no
admissible claims to any country as exclusively
their own, and distinguished from
the other races of men by physical and
moral qualities peculiar to themselves.
The different gradations of climate, and the
state of civilisation of the countries in which
they are born and brought up, do not seem
to affect them in the same manner as the
other classes of human nature, and in many
respects they appear little superior to the
brute creation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wallachia and Moldavia contain about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>one hundred and fifty thousand gypsies,
and make a more profitable use of them
than other countries do, by keeping them
in a state of regular slavery. The period
of their first coming there is not exactly
ascertained; but there is every reason to
believe it dates with the irruption of the
gypsies from Germany in the fifteenth
century; and they are mentioned in some
manuscripts, possessed by Wallachian and
Moldavian convents, evidently written towards
that period.</p>

<p class='c007'>They are remarkable, as every where
else, for their brown complexion; their
bodily constitution is strong, and they are so
hardened from constant exposure to all the
rigours of the weather, that they appear fit
for any labour and fatigue; but their natural
aversion to a life of industry is in
general so great, that they prefer all the
miseries of indigence, to the enjoyment of
comforts that are to be reaped by persevering
exertion. The propensity to stealing
seems inherent in them, but they do not
become thieves with the view of enriching
themselves; their thefts never extend beyond
trifles.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>The women have the same complexion,
with fine and regular features. They are
very well shaped before they become
mothers; but soon after they begin to have
children, and they are generally very fruitful,
their beauty gives way to a disgusting
ugliness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both sexes are slovenly and dirty: the
filth and vermin with which their bodies
are infected, seem to form a necessary part
of their existence, as no consideration can
induce them to be cleanly. Most of them
are clothed with a few rags, and their
children go naked at almost all seasons.</p>

<p class='c007'>They acknowledge no particular religion
as their own; neither do they think of
following the precepts of any, unless, acting
as domestic slaves, they are ordered so to
do by their masters. Among themselves
they dispense with the religious ceremony
of marriage, and although many live together
as husbands and wives, they are only
bound by the ties of nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>The women are of the most depraved
character: none of them follow the regular
line of public prostitutes, but at the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>time none refuse their favours when the
slightest offer of money is made.</p>

<p class='c007'>In both principalities the gypsies are
divided into two distinct classes of slaves;
the one is composed of those who are the
property of government, and the other, of
those who belong to private individuals.
No regular traffic of them is carried on in
the country, neither is it customary to expose
to public inspection any who are to
be disposed of. Both sales and purchases
are conducted in private, and the usual
price for one of either sex, is from five to
six hundred piasters.</p>

<p class='c007'>The number of gypsies belonging to the
two governments, altogether amounts to
eighty thousand, including women and
children. They are suffered to stroll about
the country, provided they bind themselves
never to leave it, and to pay an annual
tribute of the value of forty piasters each
man, above the age of fifteen. We have
mentioned on the subject of the gold and
silver mines, how those of Wallachia pay
their share of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>They are dispersed in different parts of
the principalities, living in separate companies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>of ten or fifteen families, under
tents; they frequently change the place of
their abode, keeping always in the neighbourhood
of towns and villages, or near
the high roads. A passenger coming in
sight of their tents is always assailed for
charity by a quantity of naked children belonging
to them, and does not easily get
rid of their importunities without throwing
a few paras to them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chief occupation, both of the men
and women, leading this vagrant life, consists
in making common iron tools, baskets,
and other wood-work of the kind for sale.
But their industry and gain are confined
to what is absolutely necessary for procuring
them the means of subsistence.
They possess a natural facility and quickness
in acquiring the knowledge of arts; but a
small number, however, devote themselves
to any, and musical performance seems to
be that to which they give the preference:
those who profess it attend the wine-houses
every day, for a trifling remuneration,
and from thence they are frequently
called to the houses of the first Boyars, on
occasions when a band of music is requisite.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>Some few become masons, and receive
one piaster for a whole day’s work. They
are always employed, with a number of
their less experienced companions, in public
buildings, and they are then allowed no
other reward but their daily food, and a
proportionable deduction from their tribute.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other class of gypsies is divided into
families belonging to Boyars and others,
who select from among them the greater
part of their household servants. The
remainder are either employed at the vineyards
of their masters, suffered to follow
common trades, or allowed to wander about
the country, upon the same conditions as
those of the government.</p>

<p class='c007'>The practice of employing gypsy slaves
in various departments of the household,
particularly in the kitchen, is universal in
both principalities; but although the expense
saved by it is considerable in houses
where a great number of servants must be
kept, the inconvenience is much greater,
though not felt. The kitchens of the
Boyars are, from the filthy habits of the
cooks, and the inattention of the masters,
not less disgusting than the common receptacles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>of swine. The incurable propensity
to vice, and the laziness of these servants,
occasion incessant trouble and vexation.
Almost at every house punishments are
instituted for them, the most severe of
which is the bastinado applied to the
naked soles of the feet: it is performed by
another gypsy, under the inspection of the
superintendent, and frequently under that
of the master or mistress. The ladies of
quality, however young and beautiful, do
not show much delicate reluctance in similar
instances of authority.</p>

<p class='c007'>The secondary punishment consists in
passing the culprit’s head through a kind
of iron helmet, with two immense horns
of the same metal, and locking it under
the chin in such a manner as to render it
extremely troublesome to the bearer, and
to prevent him from eating or drinking, as
long as he keeps it on.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is, however, certain, that the gypsy
servants can neither be kept in proper
order without punishment, nor be made to
go through any long work without the
stimulus of stripes. The private owners
have not the power of death over them;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>but it has happened sometimes, that some
unfortunate wretch has been beaten to
death, and neither the government nor
the public took notice of the circumstance.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is under the care of these depraved
servants, that the children of Boyars are
brought up. The women of the higher
ranks not being in the habit of nursing
their infants, place them in the hands of
gypsy wet-nurses, whose mode of life exposes
them incessantly to diseases which
must prove most prejudicial to the quality
of their milk, and whose bad nourishment
and dirty habits, must otherwise affect the
constitution of the children.</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding that the gypsies form
here so necessary a part of the community,
they are held in the greatest contempt by the
other inhabitants, who, indeed, treat them
little better than brutes; and the insulting
epithet of ‘thief,’ or any equivalent, would
sooner be put up with than that of ‘gypsy.’</p>

<p class='c007'>The public executioners for any kind of
punishment are chosen from that class
alone; but as their office is merely momentary,
the unfortunate beings condemned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>always suffer considerably more from their
inexperience and incapacity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Wallachian and Moldavian gypsies
speak the language of the country; but
those who lead a wandering life use, amongst
themselves, a peculiar jargon composed of
a corruption of Bulgarian, Servian, and
Hungarian words, mixed with some Turkish.
Its pronunciation, however, sounds so much
like that of the Hungarian tongue, that a
person accustomed to hear both without
understanding either, is apt to mistake the
one for the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>Their quality of slaves is acknowledged
by the surrounding nations; and those who
abscond to them are restored when claimed
as private property. Desertions, however,
are not frequent; and when they do take
place, the fugitives take such precautions as
to prevent the place of their concealment
being discovered.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <span class='large'>INTERCOURSE OF FOREIGNERS.—FOREIGN CONSULS.—HOW FAR THE NATIVES ARE BENEFITED BY THEIR INTERCOURSE WITH FOREIGN RESIDENTS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>A considerable number of foreign Europeans
reside in both principalities, where
they are attracted by a variety of resources.</p>

<p class='c007'>The principal merchants and bankers,
either from birthright or from foreign
naturalisation, carry on their business under
the immediate protection of European
courts; without which the general system
of the local governments, so prejudicial to
the interests of trade, would give but little
security to their operations.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are at both capitals several
German and French coachmakers, carpenters,
builders, architects, teachers of European
languages and music, physicians, and
apothecaries, all of whom have rendered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>themselves extremely useful to the native
inhabitants, and derive no small profit from
the exercise of their respective professions.
Almost all the importers of foreign furniture,
luxuries in ladies’ apparel and other
kinds of retail trade, undertakers of subscription-clubs,
and of coffee-houses of the
better sort, ladies’ shoemakers, mantuamakers,
and taylors, are also European
foreigners.</p>

<p class='c007'>A great number of Transylvanian and
Hungarian gentry of the inferior rank are
attracted by the advantages of renting the
Boyars’ estates. According to the treaties
existing between the Porte and other
powers, foreign subjects are not permitted
in any manner to hold, as proprietors, landed
property in the Ottoman dominions; the
prince of Moldavia observing how little this
stipulation had been attended to in his
principality, thought it necessary, in 1815,
to issue a decree which ordered the expulsion
of foreign farmers. The Boyars, whose
best estates were under their management,
and who had every reason to be satisfied
with them, strongly opposed the measure;
their representations finally induced the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>prince to give his tacit consent to their
wishes; and, properly speaking, this stipulation
of the treaties does not include the
principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia,
and ought not to be applied to them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The progress of the Russian arms previous
to the peace of Kaïnargik, had enabled
the cabinet of St. Petersburgh to become
the arbiter of the fate of Turkey. Whatever
might have been the Empress Catharine’s
motives for consenting to the conclusion
of that peace, she did not remain less
sanguine in her favourite project of conquering
the empire of the East, and the
special clauses in the treaty, which gave
her the power of interfering in the affairs
of the Wallachians and Moldavians, were
calculated not only to secure to her the
affections of the people for whom they were
most immediately intended, but at the same
time to incline the other Christian subjects
of Turkey to look upon her as their natural
defender, and their future deliverer.</p>

<p class='c007'>No subsequent events prevented her
from employing her right of interference,
though, according to circumstances, it may
at times have been exercised with more or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>less energy; and the policy pursued by her
successors evidently denotes the continuation
of a system which has an important
object in view, however distant the possibility
of attaining it.<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c012'><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>In order, however, to exercise her influence
with the activity necessary to ensure
success, the empress had insisted also that
the Porte should acknowledge the residence
in the two principalities of imperial agents,
to whom she thought proper to give the
title of consuls, as most adapted to screen
her views, and to justify her apparent one
of enlarging the trade of her empire, and
giving protection and assistance to those of
her subjects who were willing to extend
their commercial transactions to the principalities.
This pretext was in fact plausible;
for the Russian merchants who had till
then been in the habit of trading in those
countries, had complained much of the
difficulties and vexations they had constantly
experienced from the irregularities
of the local governments.</p>

<p class='c007'>However unwilling to recognise the future
residence of public agents from the court of
Russia, the Porte was unable to oppose it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>with any prospect of success, and consequently
consented.</p>

<p class='c007'>The court of Vienna soon after followed
the example, though from motives of a more
commercial nature; and the consuls of
Russia once admitted, the Ottoman government
could not refuse to acknowledge those
of Austria.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Greeks saw with no little regret the
arrival of these foreign agents, who not only
checked their authority over the foreign
trade, but became also competent witnesses
of their political system and administration,
and the accredited reporters of all their
actions. But, as it was out of their power
to oppose the arrangements of the imperial
courts, they thought it best to set their submission
to the profit of their vanity in receiving
the consuls as envoys sent by foreign
powers to independent princes. They introduced
for their reception the formalities
and ceremonial of the public audiences
given by the Grand Vezier to European ambassadors
at Constantinople, and they revived
the custom of the Voïvodes, of being
seated on an elevated throne on similar occasions.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>Under the republic of France, French
consuls were sent for the first time to reside
in the principalities, and their establishment
has been kept up without interruption
under the successive governments of France.
On several occasions they were very useful
to Buonaparte.</p>

<p class='c007'>A British consul-general was for the first
time appointed in 1802 to reside at Bukorest,
chiefly for the purpose of facilitating
the overland communications between England
and Turkey. After the peace of Tilsit
he was recalled, and the consulate was renewed
in 1813, with the additional motive
of promoting commercial intercourse with
the principalities.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pope has for many years been represented
by a bishop in Wallachia, and
by a vicar in Moldavia; the latter has
recently been promoted to the rank of a
bishop.</p>

<p class='c007'>The number of Roman Catholic inhabitants
is considerable; most of the Servian,
Bulgarian, and Transylvanian settlers belong
to that persuasion. They have two fine
churches at Bukorest and at Yassi.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>There are also two protestant churches
originally founded by Charles XII. of Sweden
during his long residence in the principalities.
They are superintended by a
vicar appointed and paid by the archbishop
of Stockholm. The protestant inhabitants
are German, and their number amounts to
one thousand. All foreign churches, provided
they profess the doctrines of christianity,
are not only tolerated in the principalities,
but allowed a variety of privileges
which they cannot enjoy in any part of the
Turkish dominions. The metropolies seldom
interfere with their affairs, and when any
circumstance obliges them so to do, they
bear every possible regard to their institutions,
and never assume the tone of superiority.</p>

<p class='c007'>In general, the social intercourse between
the natives and foreign inhabitants is carried
on upon a much more friendly footing than
might be expected from the number of national
prejudices that still divide them, in
opinions, religion, and established customs.
The natural hospitality of the Boyars makes
no exceptions with foreigners; and if on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>one hand this quality loses a part of its
merit in being the mere effect of custom, on
the other it does not deserve the less credit
when totally divested of ostentatious motives.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would appear that little benefit is to be
expected by the inhabitants of a country
long occupied by Russian armies, and made
the principal theatre of military operations.
Yet the late intercourse between those of
the principalities, and the Russians, and the
prospect of their being incorporated with
the Russian empire, have, in many respects,
improved their civilisation. A variety of
barbarous customs existing before have
been abolished; usages and institutions were
introduced which tended to their improvement,
and the exterior manners of the
Boyars have undergone a polish which is
not unworthy of more enlightened nations.
Those of Moldavia would view with pleasure
any political change in their country which
offered to them the sure prospect of improvement
in civilisation. Those of Wallachia
have long since consoled themselves
for the improbability of any early change,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>by taking a very active part in the general
system of rapacity, of which it has become
the lot of their countrymen of inferior order
to bear the weight.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>GENERAL OBSERVATIONS<br /> <span class='small'>ON THE</span><br /> <span class='large'>POLITICAL POSITION OF THE PRINCIPALITIES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>When we reflect upon the deplorable condition
of Wallachia and Moldavia, examine
the causes of their evils, and cast an eye
upon the numerous gifts with which nature
has enriched them,—when we compare
the effects of demoralisation and ruin, which
are the natural consequences of their present
system of administration, to the advantages
that would accrue to them from a
regular and permanent form of government,—it
is hardly possible not to regret that
the question of a change in their political
fate was not proposed and resolved at the
late congress of Vienna.</p>

<p class='c007'>A variety of facts related in the foregoing
pages have, perhaps, sufficiently demonstrated
the nullity of the independence
still acknowledged by the Ottoman Court
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>to the constitution of its transdanubean
Principalities, and the little regard it bears
to the common prosperity of their affairs.
That those countries should resume independency,
and maintain themselves in it by
their own means alone, would, however, be
as absurd, as it is impossible to expect. But
that they should be rescued from the hands
of those who act as their worst enemies,
and placed under the special protection of
some great Christian power, under whose
influence they might be enabled to employ
their resources to their own profit and to
that of their neighbours, give to their trade
all the extent it is capable of compassing,—under
which, in short they might have
the hope of soon placing themselves on a
footing with the civilised world—formed
an object which called forth the attention
of Christian Europe, and which, in magnitude
and importance, had at least equal
claims to it as the question relating to the
Ionian Islands, to which the Turks had no
smaller pretensions, though neither more
nor less valid.</p>

<p class='c007'>Conformity of religion, and the old standing
connections between Russia and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia,
point out that power as their natural protector;
but, if the security of Europe forbids
the recognition of further encroachments
of the Russians on Turkey, though
at the same time the political change in
the principalities had been once regularly
admitted, would not a partition made of
them between Austria and Russia have
been equally beneficial in its consequences,
and at all events preferable in every respect
to the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">statu quo</span></i>? Indeed, upon the very
principle of impeding the progress of
Russia, the occupation of Wallachia by the
Austrians was a measure of the first necessity,
as sufficiently capable of forming an
insurmountable barrier against the Russians.
Without it, what obstacle will ever prevent
these from extending the whole of their
frontier on the side of European Turkey to
the Danube? and once entirely masters of
the borders of that river, the road to Constantinople
is open to them, and the political
existence of the Turkish empire is left
to depend on the will and pleasure of the
Russian emperor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Austria, as long as she is willing to maintain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>her present extent of power, would
certainly feel herself far from secure at the
approach of the Russians on so great a line
of her eastern frontiers, and would not
tacitly consent to be severed from Turkey
in a manner so as to alter materially the
course of her communications with that
country, and almost to preclude the possibility
of affording it future assistance;
neither would the rest of Europe, interested
in obstructing the further designs of aggrandisement
of Russia, view such an event
without alarming apprehensions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The precautions which the best political
prudence could have suggested, ought, therefore,
to have brought the Austrians into
Wallachia, where they should have improved
the fortifications at the most essential points.
Such a measure, carried into execution, the
Russians would in vain have attempted new
encroachments; they could not have made
one step into Turkey without the permission
of the Austrians.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been said that the Russian plenipotentiaries
at the congress of Vienna observed
so profound a silence with respect to
Turkish affairs, and so carefully avoided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>any opportunities of hearing them named,
as to prove evidently, that in her concerns
with that Power Russia wishes to remain
her own arbiter. Perhaps, by that conduct,
she prevented what she feared; for, had the
partition of Wallachia and Moldavia been
proposed to her, with the cession of the
latter province to herself, could she possibly
have brought forwards any reasonable objections?
The arrangement would have appeared
so suitable to all parties, that she
could not have opposed it without betraying
ambitious and subversive views; Turkey
must have consented, if she bore any regard
to her own future safety; and the inhabitants
of the principalities, notwithstanding
that they would in both have preferred the
patronage of Russia to any interference of
Austria, would soon have begun to feel the
importance of the change in their favour.</p>

<p class='c007'>What are the effects of the present
system?—</p>

<p class='c007'>The policy of the Turks in the principalities,
renders them detestable to their inhabitants.
They send men devoid of principles,
bereft of all feelings of humanity, to
exhibit a farce of sovereignty over them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>and to display an arrogant and insulting
power, in order to intimidate them into
submission, and to impose with less difficulty
an almost intolerable yoke. These
agents of authority are looked upon by the
two nations, whom they are sent to govern,
not as their natural well-wishers, but as the
chief enemies of the State; and the Turks
being justly considered as the true authors
of all their evils, the hand of vengeance is
constantly raised over them, waiting for the
opportunity when it can act with most
efficacy.<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c012'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>Russia is perfectly aware that such sentiments
and dispositions constantly prevail
amongst the Wallachians and Moldavians.
The authority which she holds from her
treaties with the Porte, enables her to interfere
in all manner with their affairs, and to
create, through their means, motives of
discord between herself and Turkey whenever
she finds a moment propitious to a
rupture; and she may even, when she
thinks proper, give an apparent urgency to
such circumstances to justify any sudden
seizure of the two provinces, operated without
any previous declaration of war, and
before the Porte could have entertained a
suspicion of her intentions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Turkey then, in being possessed of Wallachia
and Moldavia on the present footing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>is only favoured with a momentary
advantage, very disproportionate to the
danger of being involved through them in
war against Russia, an event which must
necessarily follow any attempts on the part
of the latter to seize on the principalities,
and which, according to the present political
arrangements existing in Europe, would not
fail to create again general convulsion.</p>

<p class='c007'>From these considerations, it would appear
evident, that as long as the transdanubean
provinces continue to be a source
of discord between Russia and Turkey, and
as long as the important question relating
to them remains unsettled, peace and tranquillity
in Europe will only be of imaginary
stability.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the pacific sentiments which so eminently
distinguish the Emperor Alexander,
we have, indeed, a solid guarantee against
any hostile attempts on Turkey; but the
life of man being so precarious, is the hope
of a long and uninterrupted peace to rest
on the mere knowledge of that sovereign’s
personal character? And even if the
Emperor Alexander should, contrary to
present expectations, march his armies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>again into Moldavia and Wallachia, for the
purpose of taking permanent possession of
them, could we, in strict justice, accuse him
of ambition in the performance of an act
which common humanity dictates to any
Christian power?</p>

<p class='c007'>It is asserted that the success of the late
great efforts against Buonaparte had, in a
great measure, depended upon the Porte’s
forbearing to take a part against Russia,
and that the allies, in order to induce the
Turkish cabinet to adhere to the resolution
it had evinced of remaining neutral, had
promised to guarantee, whatever might
happen, the integrity of the Ottoman
empire; that the Porte, subsequently relying
on this promise, declared itself entirely
foreign to the objects in discussion at the
congress of Vienna, and consequently was
not invited to send ministers to it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, that the co-operation of Turkey,
with or against Russia and her allies, could
have made the least impression on the destinies
of Europe, at a time that the nation
itself seemed so decidedly averse to the
resumption of a war, and that the state
was exhausted, appears most doubtful; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>that the participation of the Turks in the
transactions of the Congress might have
settled affairs in a much more solid and
lasting manner, is extremely probable. It
is at that universal tribunal alone, formed
for the vast purpose of creating a just and
unchangeable equilibrium in the political
affairs of Europe, that the Turks might
have been made to understand and to feel
the necessity of renouncing to possessions
beyond the Danube, which, as they have no
longer the means of maintaining and defending
them, must, in their hands, continue
to be a source of unceasing contentions,
and a subject of wars, which will not
only endanger the safety of the Ottoman
empire, but also compromise the tranquillity
of all Europe; and that the Danube being,
in fact, the natural frontier of their present
extent of empire in that part of it, is alone
calculated to offer them security. And
those tottering Ottomans, whose existence
in Europe is already tolerated with too
much indulgence, and who must be aware,
notwithstanding the high opinion they
entertain of their own importance, how
much they are at the mercy of Christian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>powers, would they have ventured to combat
any decisions of the congress which deprived
them of a comparatively small extent
of territory to enable them to preserve the
remainder of their possessions in Europe?
Could they have insisted upon the strict
observance of former promises, when circumstances
so important, concurring even
to their own safety, revoked them, and
whilst they themselves have, in many instances,
been guilty of infractions to their
very treaties?</p>

<p class='c007'>No opportunity was ever, or will, perhaps,
be again so favourable to the decision of this
important question, as the Congress of
Vienna; however, it passed there under
general silence. This silence may indeed
have originated in motives of great weight,
but it could only have been of a momentary
necessity, and probably it will not a little
contribute to the causes of the first hostile
shot that will be fired on the continent of
Europe.</p>

    <div>The Emperor Sultan Mahmoud,</div>
    <div>Son of Sultan Abdoulhammid</div>
    <div>Ever Victorious!</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>By that glorious and imperial sign, I, who am
the conqueror of the world, and whose authority
is derived from Divine will,</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>Ordain as follows:</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The Model of the Great amongst the nation
of the Messiah, the Ambassador Extraordinary
from the Court of Great Britain residing at my
Sublime Porte, Robert Liston, (whose end be
happiness,) has presented to my Imperial Porte
an official note, by which he states that it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>agreed by the Imperial capitulations that the
English shall have the right to name consuls to
Smyrna, Alexandria, Aleppo, Tripoli, Algiers,
Tunis, and various other parts of my Empire;
and that, when they wish to recall them no opposition
shall be made: that in virtue of this
agreement, Francis Summerers had been named
the 3d of the Ramazan, 1217 (6th January
1802), consul-general in the principalities of
Wallachia and Moldavia, (acknowledged by Imperial
Beratt,) to protect the affair of the English
merchants and other subjects who carry on
business with those Countries, as well as to
assist the passage of couriers and letters to and
from England, and having resigned that office,
the bearer of this Imperial document, one of
the most noble of the nation of the Messiah,
William Wilkinson, has been appointed consul-general
in his place. The aforesaid Ambassador,
in notifying his nomination, requests, that
in virtue of the Imperial capitulations, this Imperial
Beratt be given him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Conforming myself to what has been hitherto
practised and to the imperial capitulations, I
give this imperial and august sign to the said
William Wilkinson, and I ordain that he shall
have henceforward the power of exercising the
functions of British Consul in the aforesaid principalities;
that he shall, according to the imperial
capitulations, have to direct the public affairs of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>the English in Wallachia and Moldavia, and
give every assistance with regard to the expedition
of couriers and dispatches to and from England.
All individuals, subjects of Great Britain,
shall have to apply directly to him when
they encounter difficulties in their affairs, and
none must be permitted to depart from those
Countries without being furnished with a passport
from him.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not allowed that the servants of consuls
be called upon to pay the capitation tax called
<em>Haratsh</em>, nor the common contributions called
<em>Avariz</em>, nor any of the arbitrary taxes and imposts
levied under the name of <em>Russumus</em>, and
<em>Tekaléfi-Urfié</em>. No one is permitted to demand
of the consuls <em>Haratsh</em> or other contributions
because they may have in their service slaves of
the one or the other sex. No one shall molest
them with regard to their private property, baggage,
or provisions; and, according to former
practice, they are exempted from custom-house
and other duties for all such objects. And as
consuls are the representatives of their governments,
they shall never be arrested; their houses
shall never be sealed, and no troops shall ever
be quartered in them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The abovementioned Consul, with his people
and slaves, is therefore exempted from <em>Haratsh</em>,
<em>Avariz</em>, <em>Hassabié-Ahtshessi</em>, and all other taxes,
impositions, &amp;c. If any one has a lawsuit with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>him, it shall be heard no where but at my
Sublime Porte.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the said Consul shall, at any time, wish to
travel to any part of my dominions, he shall not
be molested by any one, either going or coming,
by sea or by land, in private houses or post-houses,
neither for his baggage, equipages, or
servants. Wherever he goes provisions shall be
given him at the common prices of the market,
and no one shall have to make the least difficulty.
Wherever he may meet with danger he
is at liberty to wear the Turkish dress with the
white turban, as also any military dress with the
sabre, bow and arrows, spurs, &amp;c. The princes,
governors, and other officers, not only shall not
molest him, but shall likewise give him every
assistance and attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>All such as do not abide by these orders shall
be punished accordingly. Every one is to conform
himself to the Imperial capitulations, and
to my glorious signature which prescribes submission;
no contrary proceeding shall be permitted
or tolerated.</p>

  <h3 class='c020'>APPENDIX, No. 2.<br /> <em>Additional Articles to the Treaty signed at Kaïnargik, the 10th July, 1775, relating to Wallachia, Moldavia, &amp;c.</em></h3>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The Court of Russia restores to the Sublime
Porte the whole province of Bessarabba, with its
fortified places, viz. Akkerman, Killia, Ismaïl,
Bender, and the other towns and villages within
that province; as well as the principalities of
Wallachia and Moldavia, with the fortresses,
capitals, towns, and villages belonging to them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Sublime Porte, in taking possession of
them, solemnly engages to observe the following
conditions, without the least deviation:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1st. To acknowledge and maintain the constitutions
of the two principalities, the established
customs, rank, dignities, property, and
churches of the two nations, without any exception
whatever: to give them total amnesty
and pardon conformably to the 1st article
of the general treaty: to leave unmolested all
such persons as have not remained faithful to the
Ottoman interest; to admit them to their former
ranks, and to restore to them any property and
possessions they had previous to the war.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>2d. To oppose no sort of difficulty to the
free exercise of the Christian religion in the said
principalities, nor to the repair or construction
of churches and other buildings.</p>

<p class='c007'>3d. To restore to the monasteries in the
neighbourhood of Ibraïl, Hotim, and Bender,
all the property belonging to them, and which
had, contrary to justice, been taken from them.</p>

<p class='c007'>4th. To acknowledge and bear all due regard
to the ecclesiastical order.</p>

<p class='c007'>5th. To permit those families and individuals
who have any desire of retiring to Russia, or
elsewhere, to depart freely with their moveable
property, and to allow them a year’s time previous
to such departure that they may settle
their affairs in the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>6th. To renounce entirely the payment of
old accounts, for whatever relates to former
contributions.</p>

<p class='c007'>7th. To claim no tribute from the inhabitants
of the said province and principalities for the
space of time that they have been occupied by
the Russians, and in consideration of the losses
and sufferings sustained by them on account of
the war, to claim no sort of tribute from them
for the space of two years after the date of the
treaty.</p>

<p class='c007'>8th. The Porte engages to show every regard
and humanity to the inhabitants of the said countries,
at and after the expiration of the term
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>mentioned in the 7th article, relative to the tribute
and taxes which they shall then be called
upon to pay, and will neither suffer nor permit
any Pasha or other person, to oppress and molest
them after the payment of the ordinary tribute.
And also to allow them the free and entire exercise
of the privileges they enjoyed during the
reign of Sultan Mehmet 4th, father to the present
Sultan. And the Porte shall permit the Hospodars
of Wallachia and Moldavia to have one
or more public agents to reside at Constantinople,
Greeks by nation or religion, who shall
have to transact the affairs of the princes; and
not only consents to acknowledge and treat with
them, but also promises to observe in them the
privileges due to persons who treat public rights
and interests, and are not under the controul of
power.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Sublime Porte also acknowledges and
admits, that the Russian ministers residing at
Constantinople, shall have the right of interfering
in behalf of the affairs of the two principalities
abovementioned, and engages to pay
every regard to their representations.<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c012'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c021'>On the 7th instant (October, 1818), a messenger
arrived in three days from Constantinople
to the Prince, and in the course of the
same day, a report was circulated all over the
town, that the prince was preparing to depart.
On the following morning the Postelnik Vlaccuzzi,
with his wife<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c012'><sup>[46]</sup></a> and family, was seen to go
out of town in a travelling carriage, and great
preparations of departure being continued at
court, the rumours increased, and people began
to be alarmed.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Sunday the 11th, after the accustomed
ceremonial at court of the Turkish Baïram, the
prince conferred titles on several persons, and
made changes in the public offices. In the afternoon
he accompanied the funeral procession of
the old Bann Golesko, and on his return home,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>he called the Spathar Balliano, the Aga Vakaresko,
and a few others into his closet, and informed
them that his life being in danger if he
continued longer in the country, he was on the
point of departure. He recommended a good
police regulation to maintain order and tranquillity,
and he named a provisional government
composed of the metropolitan, Brancovano,
and Samourkash, whom he instructed to
act during his absence, until the Porte should
determine on new measures of administration.
He also sent for the Russian Consul-General Mr.
Pini, and after having prevailed on him to take
charge of such private concerns as he had not
had time to settle, he took a friendly leave of
them all, and got into his ordinary <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">calèche</span></i>, attended
by two servants only, as if going to take
his usual evening drive. He repaired to Banessa,
where he was joined by the princess his wife,
the princess Rallou his daughter, and her husband
the Bann Argiropulo, the young prince
Constantine, the Postelnik Mavrocordato, the
Aga Vlangalli, and a few servants, who were all
waiting with travelling carriages and post-horses,
baggage, &amp;c. They all set out together, and at
a mile’s distance from Banessa, they were joined
by four hundred Albanians, (the prince’s body-guards) well mounted and well armed. They
directed their course to Kronstadt in Transylvania,
where they arrived in safety, after four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>days journey, and were well received by the
Austrian General commanding on the frontiers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The four hundred guards were sent back,
and the Prince, whilst on the road, transmitted
various orders to the provisional government,
as if he continued to be the only chief of the
country.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is said he will not stop long at Kronstadt,
but will proceed on to Switzerland, where he
intends to fix his abode.</p>

<p class='c007'>Immediately after his departure, the Russian
consul placed the imperial seal on all the
apartments of the court, some of which contained
furniture, and other articles of much
value, after which he laid a formal sequester upon
the Prince’s private property, under the plea that
he had left unpaid several debts to Russian
merchants.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the Boyars assembled on the 12th, and
wrote to the Porte the particulars of this unexpected
event, they have since held several deliberations,
and have finally agreed to send a
petition to the Sultan, representing all the miseries
to which they were exposed under the administration
of Greek Princes, praying that he
would henceforward confide the government of
the principality to the Divan alone, and engaging
themselves to observe faithfully all the conditions
that have been hitherto prescribed to
the Hospodars. We are now waiting with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>anxiety to learn the nature of the measures that
the Porte will deem most proper to adopt, and
the moment is of no small importance to the
fate of this country. Meanwhile we live under
continual apprehension that the Turkish Pashahs
of the neighbourhood may take upon themselves
to send troops in order to occupy the country,
a circumstance which, instead of producing the
good effects of precaution, will throw every
thing into confusion and disorder, and frighten
away a great number of families, who, in that
expectation, are already making preparations to
retire into Transylvania and Moldavia.</p>

<hr class='c019' />

<p class='c007'><em>10th December.</em>—Every thing went on quietly.
The Sultan, after deliberating in his council
on the subject of the Boyars’ petition, has
refused to comply with their demand, and has
appointed Prince Alexander Sutzo new Hospodar
of Wallachia. His Caïmacams have already
arrived, and have taken the momentary direction
of public affairs. We know for certain that
Prince Caradja, who has left Kronstadt, will
fix his residence at Geneva.</p>

  <h3 class='c020'>APPENDIX, No. 5.<br /> <em>An explanation of the Nizam-y-Gedid institution, and some curious remarks concerning it. Written by Tshelebi-Effendi, one of the chief dignitaries of the Ottoman Empire, Counsellor, Minister of State, &amp;c. and translated from the original Turkish manuscript.</em></h3>
</div>

<h4 class='c022'>PREFACE.</h4>

<p class='c021'>The most high God, who hath willed that the
race of the children of Adam should endure
from the time of Adam, even unto the day of
judgment, hath, by the mysterious decrees of
his Divine Providence, created an Emperor of
the world, to administer with justice the affairs
of the whole company of his servants, and to
protect them from their enemies.<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c012'><sup>[47]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is by repelling hostile violence that the
affairs of the world are maintained in due order;
since the Divine Majesty hath subjected the
earth to government in such a manner that it is
divided into many regions, each of them should
have its own Sovereign, and that the places subject
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>to each Sovereign, and the servants of God whom
they contain, should find in their rulers (each
according to the power he possesses, and the
age in which he lives) a protection and security
from the malice and treachery of their hostile
neighbours and other enemies.</p>

<p class='c007'>As those States which guard against dishonour,
and by daily improving and confirming
their system of government, obtain in these
respects a superiority over the neighbouring nations,
have flourished accordingly; in like manner,
decay and destruction have been the lot of
such as in these points have been inferior to the
countries adjoining them; because it is the invariable
nature of the children of Adam to
lengthen the hand against the dominion and
wealth of the weak and indolent.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is said in the history which treats of the
terms of peace concluded by the sublime person
who has received the mercy of God<a id='r48'></a><a href='#f48' class='c012'><sup>[48]</sup></a>, that those
States which from carelessness did not take proper
precautions to guard against the violence of
strangers, have remained without either honour
or reputation, and dependent upon others. Or
even from the consequence of their negligence,
having fallen entirely into the hands of foreigners,
their kings have become subjects, and
their rich men poor. It is a principle to be observed
by those who rule governments, and are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>men of understanding and penetration, that,
“even if your enemy is an ant, you should use
every effort against him;” that conformably to
this proverb, they may not suffer themselves to
be brought into calamity, by the treacherous
machinations of the neighbouring States, and
other hostile nations.</p>

<p class='c007'>The purpose of this preface is as follows:—In
the period which elapsed from the year 1150
to the year 1182 of the Hejira, the greatest part
of those who had seen service before the conclusion
of the wars, went to the confines of nonexistence.<a id='r49'></a><a href='#f49' class='c012'><sup>[49]</sup></a>
And those who had not seen service,
having never travelled an hour’s journey
from home, were entirely ignorant of the affairs
of the enemies of religion.<a id='r50'></a><a href='#f50' class='c012'><sup>[50]</sup></a> It followed that
the greater part of the inhabitants of the Sublime
Empire<a id='r51'></a><a href='#f51' class='c012'><sup>[51]</sup></a> lived in an easy, careless manner,
and had never experienced the vicissitudes of
fortune. The corruption and disorder that prevailed
in the discipline of our troops during the
Russian war which broke out in the year 1182<a id='r52'></a><a href='#f52' class='c012'><sup>[52]</sup></a>,
gave rise to the confusion in which the world
has been involved from that time to this, a space
of near forty years. Although the truth of this
is evident to a few men of sagacity and penetration,
who, remaining from the former generation,
may be enumerated out of the vulgar herd, yet,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>on account of the situation in which the world
is, and the circumstances of the times, most of
them are obliged, in their discourse, to appear
to agree with the opinions of the people at
large.</p>

<p class='c007'>For some time past, a rabble composed of the
dregs of the populace, setting themselves up for
judges of the times, and assembling in the
coffee-houses, barbers’ shops, and taverns, have,
in vain speeches, unbecoming their station, indulged
themselves in the liberty of abusing and
calumniating the Sublime Government; and as
they have not been visited by the punishment
which they deserve, people of this sort have
thence been emboldened to say whatever they
please. This system has often brought the Sublime
Government into trouble.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the times of Suleÿman Khan Kannuni<a id='r53'></a><a href='#f53' class='c012'><sup>[53]</sup></a> the
Just, a few ignorant men who did not approve
of the new system then promulgated, having got
together in one place, railed against the Sublime
Government, uttering whatever tedious and absurd
speeches came uppermost in their mouths.
This circumstance coming to the knowledge of
the Emperor, he cut off the ears and tongues
both of the railers and listeners, and nailed
them, for an example to the world, on the upper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>porch of a small gate near the palace of Sultan
Bayazid. As this place was a thoroughfare for the
public, all those who with their eyes contemplated
the sight, learned to restrain their tongues. At
that time, as at the present period, the greater
part of the vulgar, in their ingratitude for benefits
conferred, resembled the children of Ismael.
This sort of rabble being ignorant that from
themselves springs the corruption of the world,
give their opinions on affairs as though they had
by inspiration received intuitive knowledge of
them, and taking no blame to themselves, as
though their own inertness was not the cause of
such misfortunes, have rendered themselves the
devil’s laughing stock. As no public examples
are made of them, owing to the lenity which now
prevails, and to certain considerations, the temper
of these times is neither fit for peace or war,
and is incapable of rendering service to government
and religion. Nevertheless, that the
world may not remain empty, a company of hogs,
corrupt and degraded like those who preceded
them, assemble in taverns, coffee-houses, and
brothels, in order to abuse and vilify the Sublime
Government. This perverse race are outwardly
Mussulmans<a id='r54'></a><a href='#f54' class='c012'><sup>[54]</sup></a>, yet have they not the least
idea of religious purity, and are indeed a collection
of baccals<a id='r55'></a><a href='#f55' class='c012'><sup>[55]</sup></a>, boatmen, fishermen, porters,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>coffee-house keepers, and such like persons.<a id='r56'></a><a href='#f56' class='c012'><sup>[56]</sup></a>
Although it would be requisite to punish many
of them for opening their mouths on state matters,
and to make public examples of them for
the purpose of restoring order to the world, yet
the force of necessity obliges the government to
overlook their faults.</p>

<p class='c007'>A treatise which should contain an accurate
account of the consequences produced by the insolence
and folly of the vulgar of this day, and
especially a correct statement of some events
which ought to be made public, having been required
of us from the highest quarter, we have
undertaken to write it in a style which is simple,
and easy to be understood. Under the Divine
favor, those who study this book with sentiments
of religion, will thereby be enabled to make
themselves acquainted with the present condition
of the world.</p>

<h4 class='c022'>SECTION I.<br /> <em>An Explanation of the Causes which have occasioned Trouble in the World.</em></h4>

<p class='c021'>“This institution of the Nizam-y-Gedid has
caused the established order of the world to be
disturbed, and has given cause to the insolent
conduct of the mountaineers in the country of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>Rumelia.” Such are the expressions employed
by a set of contentious and ignorant men, incapable
of learning reason. I have sometimes
questioned such persons, saying as follows:—“Ho,
friend! allow me in the first place to ask
you a question. What is this institution against
which you make such continual and senseless
outcry? First know precisely what it is, and
then continue to oppose it. If there be reason
in what you say, I am open to conviction, and
am ready to concede the point in dispute.” On
hearing this, all they could say was, that what
they call the Nizam-y-Gedid, is a body of troops
trained and exercised; beyond which, and a
mere profession of their aversion to it, they
plainly showed that they knew nothing about
the matter. Although I saw that an attempt to
make this kind of rabble understand public
affairs, is like trying to make a camel leap over
a ditch, I proceeded to put some questions that
occurred to me, as follows:—“Shall I give you
some account of the troubles which occurred in
the world before the Nizam-y-Gedid existed,
during the reigns of their highnesses the former
Ottoman Sultans, who have found mercy from
God? Such as the disturbances raised in Anatolia
by the Gellalli<a id='r57'></a><a href='#f57' class='c012'><sup>[57]</sup></a>, and the insolence of
Sarry Beÿ Oglou in the reign of Sultan Mahmoud,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>and especially the events which passed in Egypt,
occasioned by Sacka-Yorghi Alli-Beÿ, the son of
a glass-blower; and the affairs of Emir-Daher,
of Abou-Vahib, all of which happened during
the reign of Sultan Moustapha; and the calamities
inflicted by the unemployed Levendis,<a id='r58'></a><a href='#f58' class='c012'><sup>[58]</sup></a>
who turned the province of Anatolia upside
down; and the continued bad success which
attended the arms of the followers of Islam, for
the space of seven years, during the Muscovite
war, which began in the year 1182; the defeats
which our great armies suffered every year, with
the loss of so many thousand tents, such abundance
of camp equipage, treasure, artillery, bombs,
and military stores, sufficient for the consumption
of many years, and so great a loss of our
troops, either taken, drowned, or killed, and the
capture as well of our small forts and retrenched
posts, as of our large fortresses, some of which
were reduced by famine and others by force;
and the impossibility of delivering so many
thousand women and children whom they contained,
and who, still remaining in captivity,
pass their lives in tears. These are things, the
bitter remembrance of which can never be
erased from our hearts. Some of these calamitous
events may be found in our annals, and some
have happened in our days. Pray was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>Nizam-y-Gedid the cause of all these disorders
and disgraceful occurrences? It did not exist at
that time, and yet you see that confusion was
already introduced, and the regular order of
things interrupted. Is then the Nizam-y-Gedid
the only cause of revolution? On what does
your dispute now rest, and what answer can you
give to my question?” After I had thus spoken,
some of them who were disposed to hear reason
yielded to conviction, and remained abashed,
having nothing to answer. But some others,
less reasonable, who knew nothing of the things
which I had spoken, answered thus:—“What
need I know about the troubles that have formerly
happened in the world? I am well aware
that those which now prevail are caused by the
Nizam-y-Gedid.” To these ignorant and pertinacious
adversaries, I again addressed myself
in these terms:—“Disturbances having broken
out in the regions of France, the people eat each
other’s flesh<a id='r59'></a><a href='#f59' class='c012'><sup>[59]</sup></a>, and the Crals<a id='r60'></a><a href='#f60' class='c012'><sup>[60]</sup></a> having declared
war against them, for the space of exactly
fifteen years, battles have been fought without
intermission, so that the country of France has
been turned upside down, and the inhabitants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>have drank each other’s blood, and poured it out
in the streets like a torrent, and have, until
this day, with the fury of dogs, changed their
country into a slaughter-house for swine. Behold
such troubles are not confined to<a id='r61'></a><a href='#f61' class='c012'><sup>[61]</sup></a> Frenghistan
alone. Neither India, nor China, Arabia, Persia,
nor the new world<a id='r62'></a><a href='#f62' class='c012'><sup>[62]</sup></a>, are at present exempt
from confusion and carnage. These things
being so, is their source to be attributed to the
Nizam-y-Gedid? We may observe, likewise, that
although trouble and bloodshed prevail in
Rumelia, yet, thanks be to God, Anatolia is free
from these calamities (may the ears of Satan be
stopped with lead<a id='r63'></a><a href='#f63' class='c012'><sup>[63]</sup></a>). Shall we say, then, that
the fatal contagion of the Nizam-y-Gedid is confined
to Rumelia, and that it has not infected
Anatolia; or rather have not these things proceeded
from the decrees of Providence? Should
not that consideration strike us? After reflecting
and meditating on what I have said, what
reply can you make?”—“Good God!” says
my opponent, “I thought Rumelia alone had
been disturbed.”—“Then,” I replied, “if you
are ignorant that every part of the world is thus
convulsed, and such things happen when there
is no Nizam-y-Gedid, and disturb the tranquillity
of the universe, you should not, by any means,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>impute the origin of dissension to that establishment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>By thus addressing them, I succeeded, by
Divine favour, in bringing many of them to conviction.
With respect to those persons, who,
although they are acquainted with the true
origin of such events, and the course of worldly
affairs, and understand and know the commands
of the great Prophet (on whom be salvation and
the peace of God), yet persevere in their perverse
opposition; and who, because they were
formerly authors of sedition, are ashamed to
belie their words, and therefore maintain the
dispute, and uphold contention; who, having
originally calumniated the corps of cannoneers
of the Nizam-y-Gedid, and abuse those who were
the authors of it, uttering speeches which do not
become their lips, on a subject above their comprehension;
with respect, I say, to such persons,
who, although they themselves confessed that
the excellence of these new troops was seen in
the French war, and that to their good conduct
many of us owed our escape from captivity, yet
afterwards forgetting this avowal, are not
ashamed to indulge in extravagant abuse of them,
it remains only, that at the five stated times of
prayer, we beseech the Divine Providence to
grant them understanding, and a knowledge of
the right way, that they may distinguish good
from evil, and acknowledge the power of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>Sublime Government with whose bread they are
fed; and that thus, by a sincere union of hearts
in the way of truth and justice, we may obtain
complete success over the enemies of the state
and of our religion. Thus did I manage my
dispute and conference with those adversaries
who attributed to the Nizam-y-Gedid the troubles
of the world. Long and tedious indeed it was;
yet by the favour of the Divine Majesty, and the
protection of the great Prophet of miraculous
memory, many of the opponents, who were at
first unwilling to hear reason, have been convinced,
and brought to entertain a just idea of
those affairs; and using their efforts to convince
others, have entered into the congregation of
well-wishers to government.</p>

<h4 class='c022'>SECTION II.<br /> <em>An Explanation of the Causes which gave rise to the Establishment of this Nizam-y-Gedid, about which so much noise has been made.</em></h4>

<p class='c021'>Be it known to men of understanding, that
after the conclusion of peace with the Muscovite
infidels, in the year 1206<a id='r64'></a><a href='#f64' class='c012'><sup>[64]</sup></a>, when ambassadors
were passing to and fro, at the time that the
prisoners were released, diligent enquiry was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>made of many persons who had been in the
hands of the Russians, with regard to the power
and condition of the enemies of our faith. In
the city called Petersburgh, which is the residence
of the Russian sovereign, are to be
found men of all nations. Among these was a
certain infidel, formerly an Ottoman Rayah, but
fixed, by his employments, in the Russian states;
a man extremely rich, and a complete master of
the art of deceit, acute and lively in speech, and
devoid of shame and modesty.</p>

<p class='c007'>This man, who was at that time become an
ambassador<a id='r65'></a><a href='#f65' class='c012'><sup>[65]</sup></a> said one day to the<a id='r66'></a><a href='#f66' class='c012'><sup>[66]</sup></a>sovereign,
in a familiar society of Franks<a id='r67'></a><a href='#f67' class='c012'><sup>[67]</sup></a>, “Why should
you give yourself the trouble of carrying on long
and obstinate wars with the Ottomans? If your
design be to take Constantinople, why should
you, by carrying on operations on the land side,
struggle with so many difficulties? Nothing is
more easy than the capture of Constantinople.”
On the sovereign’s desiring to know which was
this easy method, the wicked person answered
as follows:—“The <em>Cralyä</em><a id='r68'></a><a href='#f68' class='c012'><sup>[68]</sup></a> having formerly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>carried on two or three successful wars, and
possessed herself of the kingdom of the Crimea,
equipped a fleet on the Black Sea, and after
annihilating the Tartar nation, and taking many
forts and castles, reduced to her obedience the
rayahs of the White Sea<a id='r69'></a><a href='#f69' class='c012'><sup>[69]</sup></a> and many trading
communities, it would be easy, by following up
a certain plan, to accomplish in two days the
conquest of Constantinople, which need only be
attacked by a single streight.” The Cralyä,
pleased with this suggestion, said, “If you prove
yourself useful in rendering me that service, I
will appoint you King of Constantinople for the
term of your life, in the same way that I
appointed a king over the country of Poland.”
The person then spoke again thus:—“None of
all the Ottoman troops are now ready to take
the field: those of Anatolia are employed in
cultivating the land, and smoking their pipes;
such as inhabit Constantinople are either busied
in carrying on various trades, or at least are not
subject to any good discipline. Were they to
assemble troops with the greatest possible expedition,
they would require at least a month for
that purpose. Behold, the water used for
drinking in so great a city, comes from certain
reservoirs which are without it.<a id='r70'></a><a href='#f70' class='c012'><sup>[70]</sup></a> It is not,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>therefore, expedient for us to carry on a troublesome
war with ships and troops by sea and by
land. We need only dispatch to the Crimea all
the Russian ships that are in the White Sea, and
there, filling with troops all our vessels, large and
small, we will disembark them suddenly without
the channel of the Black Sea, in the district that
contains the reservoirs, the walls of which we
will beat down with our cannon and<a id='r71'></a><a href='#f71' class='c012'><sup>[71]</sup></a>destroy.
In one hour this may be effected. On the
waters running out, the consequence will be a
great tumult at Constantinople, the news being
every where spread that the Russians have destroyed
the reservoirs of water, that they are
about to assault Constantinople with all their
forces, and that their ulterior projects are not
known. In the space of one day the want of
water will produce confusion among them, which
will be augmented by our zealous partisans of
the Greek nation. The troops which are in
Constantinople, instead of marching immediately
against us, will pillage the public treasures, and
those of their emperor, ministers, and rich men;
and putting their booty hastily on board such
boats and vessels as they find at hand, will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>endeavour to fly to Anatolia and elsewhere.
The residue of the inhabitants, who remain at
Constantinople, being left to themselves in this
calamity, and overwhelmed with astonishment,
having no water to bake bread, or to drink, will,
in the course of two days, be reduced to the last
extremity. So that the Russian troops, gradually
advancing and entering the city, will make
themselves entire masters of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Sublime Government having received intelligence
of this conversation, and of the decision
taken in consequence of it<a id='r72'></a><a href='#f72' class='c012'><sup>[72]</sup></a>, the infernal treachery
of the aforesaid wicked person, seemed really
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>to have conceived a feasible project. Water
sleeps, and enemy is sleepless.<a id='r73'></a><a href='#f73' class='c012'><sup>[73]</sup></a> It is especially
to be considered, that the distance from the
peninsula of the Crimea to the channel of the
Black Sea, is such, that a ship may cross it
without altering a sail; and whatever confidence
we may place in our own strength,
yet, God forbid that so cunning an enemy
should find us in an unguarded posture; particularly
since we are instructed by the example
of so many States, that owed their loss of
reputation and ruin to the want of care in observing
the machinations of their enemies, and
in neglecting to provide in proper time efficient
troops and military stores. From this source
their calamities have arisen, as is written and
set forth, as well in other histories, as in that
which treats of the misfortune of the Sublime
Person, who has received the mercy of<a id='r74'></a><a href='#f74' class='c012'><sup>[74]</sup></a>God,
and of the peace which he concluded. The
Russian infidels having withal greatly improved
the state of their dominions within the space of
seventy or eighty years, and manifested their
thirst of glory by their arrogant and insolent interference
in the interior affairs of other States,
and having annexed several foreign countries to
their own dominions, especially the kingdom of
Poland, we must not, by any means, consider
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>ourselves secure from so treacherous and deceitful
a nation. Besides all this, the upright and
provident ministers of the Sublime Government,
who are aware of the evil designs of the enemy,
having represented to the Emperor, (who is at
the summit of power, and inhabits the mansions
of wisdom and understanding,) that if such an
attempt as that suggested to the Cralyä by the
before-mentioned reprobate, should actually take
place against the reservoirs, (which God forbid!)
as there had been no care taken to provide
either money or troops, it would be utterly impossible
to dispatch with expedition against the
enemy forces that were under no discipline, or
to repulse them with such soldiers; and that the
people of the Empire of Islam, reposing entirely
on the protection of Providence, would not
make the least resistance. That therefore, as it
was a maxim established that in an urgent case,
when some remedy must be sought, resources
must be found in the whole body of those who
are attached to government, without consulting
the lower orders; there was no other method of
dispelling and removing the danger we have
spoken of above, but by keeping a body of
troops on foot ready for service. It was also
taken into consideration, that even if the description
of force required for the purpose
really existed at Constantinople; yet in case of
any danger arising on the side of the reservoirs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>in the way we have mentioned, (which Heaven
forbid!) as the intelligence must be conveyed
from thence to Constantinople, and as the troops
must assemble, it would require five days at
least before they could reach their destination.
May God protect and guard us! “The serpent
kills a man in Egypt whilst the Teryak<a id='r75'></a><a href='#f75' class='c012'><sup>[75]</sup></a> is
coming from Venice,” as the proverb says.</p>

<p class='c007'>With regard to the apprehensions entertained
for the reservoirs, it appeared in every case indispensably
necessary, that on that side a body
of troops should be kept in readiness in some
fixed station, and provided with requisite supply
of artillery, ammunition, and military stores;
and such troops as should not, like the rest of
our forces, be composed of sellers of pastry,
boatmen, fishermen, coffee-house keepers, baccals,
and others who are engaged in the thirty-two
trades, but of well disciplined men, who would
take care to have their cannon and muskets ready
for service, and on an urgent occasion, would
be prepared in the space of half an hour to engage
the troops and artillery of the enemy; to
repulse them, and retaliate on them their own
hostile devices. After these points had been
taken into serious consideration, some men were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>in the first place dispatched to the corps of the
Janissaries for the purpose of selecting from
thence some young and chosen soldiers, whom
they were to discipline and train to the use of
arms. Upon this, our bravoes who are engaged
in the thirty-two trades, considering that if they
were obliged to attend punctually to the exercise
of cannon and small arms, they would be
occupied with that instead of their private affairs,
and would be brought into trouble, no longer receiving
their pay once in three months gratuitously,
and without doing any thing for it,
began to ponder the matter, stroaking their
beards and mustachios, and to vent their discontent
by saying, “We are not made for this
sort of work, and we will have nothing to do
with it.” Whatever pains were taken to enlighten
their understandings, they obstinately
persisted, addressing each other by these or similar
terms, “Ho! Alli Sacka Baba, Oda Bashi,
Bash Karakouloukgee!<a id='r76'></a><a href='#f76' class='c012'><sup>[76]</sup></a> what say you to this
business? the exercise of the Nizam-y-Gedid is
now introduced; henceforth no pay is to be had
without service, and what they call exercise is a
very troublesome service; it is true that drawing
up in a line makes a better show; but if they
send us to war, we can fire our muskets, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>then charging sword in hand, we can put the
Russians to flight and storm their camp. May
Heaven preserve from decay our corps and our
chiefs! we shall then take our pay when it is
issued, and pass our time agreeably.” Such
were their expressions, as though they could by
frigid reasoning, and senseless allusions, induce
the Sublime Government to abandon this enterprise,
when the experience of two wars had
proved, beyond dispute, both the total inefficiency
of their services, and the feeble condition
of the Mahometan community.</p>

<p class='c007'>With respect to the apprehensions entertained
of the destruction of those fine reservoirs by the
Russian infidels, the first step which was taken
for the purpose of procuring speedy and effectual
means of guarding against so devilish a piece of
treachery, consisted in an ordinance for levying
a body of Bostangees<a id='r77'></a><a href='#f77' class='c012'><sup>[77]</sup></a>, who were to be quartered
at the Levend-Chifflick, a military post
newly established at no great distance from the
reservoirs, in order that in an urgent crisis
when we fly for refuge to Divine protection,
they might be ready for service in a very short
space of time. But the most important point is
this: that the new levied troops, instead of engaging
in trade, should remain day and night in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>their quarters, applying themselves daily to military
exercises, and keeping their arms, cannon,
muskets, and warlike implements of every
description necessary for immediate service;
thus practising a discipline suitable to their appellation
of soldiers of the new regulation. To
complete all, every Orta<a id='r78'></a><a href='#f78' class='c012'><sup>[78]</sup></a> led an <em>Imam</em><a id='r79'></a><a href='#f79' class='c012'><sup>[79]</sup></a> attached
to it for the due performance of religious
worship, that nothing requisite might be omitted.
Besides this, numerous batteries are established
on the shores of the canal of the Black Sea<a id='r80'></a><a href='#f80' class='c012'><sup>[80]</sup></a>, well
furnished with artillery, and a sufficient number
of gunners were appointed to serve them, and
to oppose any attempt which might be made by
the enemies of our faith, to force the passage of
the said canal. As the perfect discipline of the
garrisons of those forts, rendered the passage of
a ship altogether impracticable, the enemies of
our faith clearly saw that the attempt must end in
their destruction; and thus, under the Divine favour,
their wicked projects, which we have already
related,were rendered fruitless and abortive.</p>

<p class='c007'>The continual and daily progress which these
new soldiers have been making in discipline and
order, and the excellent conduct and steady
valour which a handful of our regular troops displayed
at Alexandria, Cairo, and Acre, have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>caused the hearts of the foes of our religion to
melt within them, on seeing and hearing these
things. We trust, that by the favour of Heaven,
when this description of our force called Nizam-y-Gedid
shall have become sufficiently numerous,
terror and consternation will take possession of
the hearts of the Russians, the Germans, and the
other enemies of our faith and Empire, to such
a degree, that they will no longer think of imposing
on the Sublime Government hard and insolent
conditions; and that, lastly, this institution
of regular soldiers, proceeding from the habitation
of the great Spirit which rules over our
faith and Empire, will perpetuate the duration
of the Sublime Government even to the end of
the world, and will give us victory over all our
enemies.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has happened to me a thousand times to find
myself engaged in dispute with a crowd of contentious
fools, who say, “Is there any occasion
for these new troops of the Nyzam-y-Gedid? At
the time that the Ottoman race conquered the
world with the sabre, there were no such forces.
Let the enemy present himself, and we will lay
our hands on our sabres, and at a single charge
make piece-meal of them. Only let us see the
intentions of our enemy, we will storm their
camp, sword in hand, upset their Cral from his
throne, trample his crown under our feet, and
penetrate even to the most distant of their
countries.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>To these bravoes I thus addressed myself:
“Hark ye, comrade! do you know that ever
since the year 1146 I, as well as my father, have
served with all my might in the corps of Janissaries,
and have been engaged in several wars,
and have seen the world both hot and cold, and
feeding from the world’s basket, have passed
through the hoop of the elements.<a id='r81'></a><a href='#f81' class='c012'><sup>[81]</sup></a> Having
moreover been a prisoner in the hands of the
enemies of religion, I became fully acquainted
with their deceit and treachery, their discipline,
and the successes which they have obtained over
the Sublime Government. It has thus been
easy for me to gain an intimate knowledge of
many things, the truth of which cannot be easily
understood from the mere perusal of our annals.
As I am now eighty-seven years of age, if all
those affairs that have passed since the year 82,
with which I am thoroughly conversant, were to
be written, they would fill several volumes. There
are, however, certain events taken as well from
history as from what has fallen under my own
observation, which I wish to relate to you;
and as my discourse shall be free from malevolence
and bad passions, I trust in God that you
will hear me with satisfaction, and will one day
bless me.”</p>

  <h4 class='c022'>SECTION III.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The subject that we are now to treat is as
follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>At the accession to the throne of that flower
of Emperors, Sultan Suleÿman Kannuni, the
science of firing with quickness artillery in position,
making use of muskets, and practising
such like military exercises, and of defeating large
armies with a very small body of troops, was not
known amongst the foreign states of Europe and
other nations. In this state of things they carried
on wars against us; and in such contests the
pious enthusiasm of the soldiers of Islam caused
the gales of victory and conquest to blow on the
side of the Sublime Government. Sometimes,
also, they were on that of the enemy. It came
to pass by a disposition of Divine Providence,
that His Highness Sultan Suleÿman having for
some years following continually met with bad
success in his wars against the Germans, and perceiving
that his defeats were owing to the unskilfulness
and want of discipline of our soldiers,
employed himself in creating a corps of regular
troops<a id='r82'></a><a href='#f82' class='c012'><sup>[82]</sup></a>, and inscribing recruits for that purpose.
Immediately a number of idle and ignorant vagabonds,
who disapproved of this institution of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>troops, quarters, and military regulations, began
to murmur, saying, “Was the world originally
conquered by the Janissaries? No; it was subdued
by the Segbans, and other valiant companies.<a id='r83'></a><a href='#f83' class='c012'><sup>[83]</sup></a>
What sort of corps is this? and what
is the meaning of these dresses? What strange
things are the water-carriers, cooks, and servants,
with their various dresses and titles!” By disseminating
these seditious speeches, they entirely
corrupted the minds of those soldiers who had
been, or were to be enrolled in the new corps of
Janissaries. So that, for instance, if an hundred
recruits had their names inscribed to-day,
to-morrow two hundred would desert.</p>

<p class='c007'>His Highness the said Emperor, reflecting on
what passed, and considering the favour which
had been granted by Divine Providence to our
magnificent Lord<a id='r84'></a><a href='#f84' class='c012'><sup>[84]</sup></a>; understanding also that
every age was gifted with some polar star of intellectual
excellence, discovered that there existed
at that period from among the sons and
successors of Hagee Bektash, the polar star of
the times. The Emperor having caused this
personage to be brought to him from Anatolia,
spoke to him of the new corps which he had
formed for the purpose of snatching victory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>from the infidels, and giving it to the people of
Islam, and demanded the prayers of this Sheich,
that the soldiers enrolled in the corps, instead of
deserting, might display constancy and firmness.
The said personage having therefore prayed,
from that day forth the recruits no longer fled,
but looking upon themselves as the children of
Hagee-Bektash, firmly persevered in their service;
and thus, when expeditions were undertaken
against the enemy by these regular troops,
who were kept closely to the pitch of discipline
necessary at that time, the happy influence as well
of the Emperor of Islam who is the chief of religious
conquerors, as of the aforesaid holy personage,
had so beneficial an effect, that they overthrew
the armies of the enemies of the faith, and gained
such signal advantages, that were we to describe
them at large, our discourse would be too prolix.
Before much time had elapsed, the enemy being
broken and routed, and perceiving by experience
the advantages of this discipline, obtained
peace with a thousand entreaties. Hereupon
all the Crals<a id='r85'></a><a href='#f85' class='c012'><sup>[85]</sup></a> being seized with consternation,
after communicating with each other, held a
council in a place appointed, to which they
invited men of wisdom and experience. The
conclusion they came to was this: “The Ottoman
Emperor having introduced an admirable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>system into his army, and established a corps for
the express purpose of keeping it up, we shall
no longer be able to keep face with such well
disciplined troops: as the soldiers of the Islam
are naturally brave, they will fall in among us,
sword in hand, and make a speedy end of us;
and as the opinion which they hold that those who
die in war are martyrs, and go immediately to Paradise,
makes them fight with great zeal, it is evident
that if we do not establish good and sufficient
military regulations, the Ottomans will conquer
the whole of Europe, and oblige us all to pay the
Haratsh. It is our business therefore to find
some method of preventing those soldiers from
closing with us.” They concluded their conference
by forming a masterly project, and inventing
a method of using with expedition their
cannon, muskets, and other instruments of war,
and prohibiting their troops from engaging in
commerce, they obliged them to pass their whole
time in learning military exercises, in which they
made such progress that it became at last impossible
to break their ranks. In truth, it is well
known to those who are acquainted with history,
that in the wars which have taken place since
the invention of this new system of tactics, the
Ottomans have been most frequently worsted,
because they found it impossible to make use of
their sabres among the infidels as they wished to
do; for their regular troops keep in a compact
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>body, pressing their feet together that their
order of battle may not be broken; and their
cannon being polished like one of<a id='r86'></a><a href='#f86' class='c012'><sup>[86]</sup></a>Marcovich’s
watches, they load twelve times in a minute,
and make the bullets rain like musket balls;
thus they keep up an unintermitted discharge of
artillery and small arms. When the Islamites
make an attack upon them with infantry or
cavalry, the enemies of our faith observe a profound
silence, till the soldiers of Islam are come
close up to their front, and then at once giving
fire to some hundred carriage-guns, and to seventy
or eighty thousand muskets, overturn our
men in heaps without so much as receiving a
bloody nose. When they have thus by a few
volleys caused thousands of the people of Islam
to drink the sherbet of martyrdom, the surviving
remnant are wont to fly. Our troops perceiving
how skilful the enemy are in the use of fire-arms,
and seeing many thousand men slain in the
space of half an hour, while they are unable to
avenge themselves on their opponents, have
necessarily begun to lose courage. But although
the wicked infidels, exerting their whole
strength, have with great prudence and boldness
invented so masterly an art of war, yet the soldiers
of Islam, who have not been able to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>any stand against them, may justly assert that
the fault does not belong to themselves; for
since the enemy sends us eighty thousand charges
of grape before a thousand of our men have time
to fire their muskets, it is certain that resistance
in such a case is beyond their power. Thus
during the period which elapsed before the reign
of his Highness Sultan Mustapha Khan, although
we were sometimes victorious and sometimes
vanquished, yet success was, for the most part,
on the side of the infidels.</p>

<p class='c007'>By explaining all this, and by giving answers
founded on the knowledge of passing events, I
have succeeded in convincing many persons,
who by falsehood endeavoured to support the
unjust opposition of the partisans of the Janissaries.
What remains to be mentioned is this:
His Highness Sultan Mahmoud, having enquired
the reason of the successes of the infidels, and
the defeats of the people of Islam, a dissertation,
treating of the way to victory, and entitled “The
Origin of Discipline,” was composed and published;
and as it afforded satisfaction to the
Emperor, copies of it were disseminated amongst
the public. I have, in the year 1206, undertaken
to write a description of the new troops,
being encouraged thereto by the favour which
the Emperor has been pleased to bestow both
on the motive and the work; but as, by the
mercy of Heaven, I have reached the extreme
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>period of life, it is very uncertain whether I
shall be able to finish the execution of it.</p>

<h4 class='c022'>SECTION IV.</h4>

<p class='c021'>“Since you cannot reconcile your minds to
the new system of exercise, and say that it is
useless, allow me in reply to put this question
to you: Was there a wall run up between you
and the infidels during the Russian war which
broke out in the reign of Sultan Mustapha
Khan? When you had consumed as much meat
and white bread as would have been sufficient
for two hundred thousand men, why did you,
while the infidels were in your sight, turn
and fly, instead of engaging them after you
had raised a commotion on the pay, rations,
and exceptions from service? You well know
that I was present with you at that time. In
the following year you committed, on your
march to the army, sundry crimes and excesses;
burning and ruining the houses in which you
were lodged, both of Mussulmans and tributary
subjects, and lengthening your hands against their
children and daughters. When you arrived at
the camp, you plainly showed what ability you
possessed for war, never having ventured in any
situation to engage or oppose the enemy, even
so much as with the sound of your voices; and
after having spent your time as you did the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>former year, in disputing about pay, &amp;c. you
departed, spoiling your brothers in religion,
and showing no fear or reverence, either for
God or man. Prove to us, if you can, that at
any time, or in any place, you have rendered
the least service to the Emperor. Such being
the state you were in for the space of six or
seven years, you at length became the cause of
the Muscovites concluding a treaty with us on
their own terms, inasmuch as through your misconduct
they were enabled to penetrate into
our territories. And to conclude all, it is owing
to you that such a province as the Crimea, the
seat of a Khan, hath remained in the hands of
the infidels.—In the late war with the Russians,
which followed the one we have been speaking
of, several thousand soldiers of the corps of
the Janissaries were detached with speed on the
side of Otchakow, with the hope that you would
effect something before the military forces of the
Russians could arrive from a distance of seven
or eight hundred hours’ march.<a id='r87'></a><a href='#f87' class='c012'><sup>[87]</sup></a> On that occasion
you paid no attention to your officers or to
the governor of Otchakow, but of your own
counsel went to attack a little entrenched port
called Kibburun, where, being engaged by a
small body of Russian troops appointed to defend
that quarter, you could not resist them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>but returned to Otchakow, after losing a great
number of men. The Muscovites then besieged
the fortress of Otchakow, remaining before it
during the season of winter, snow, and extreme
cold, whilst you crept into holes within the
place, and did not dare to venture out. Thus
you were the occasion of the enemy’s taking by
assault, and by force of arms, so strong and firm
a bulwark of Islamism, together with all its inhabitants,
who were made prisoners. And to
you it is owing that so many thousand persons,
with their wives, daughters, and young children,
fell into the hands of the Russians. In
other places you were equally unable to resist.
As the superiority which the practice of military
exercise gives to the infidels in war is clearly
evident, as well as the deficiency of the people
of Islam in several points connected with military
science, is not the obstinacy with which
you oppose the introduction of this exercise,
purely a treason against our religion and empire?”
When I had thus set forth and laid
before them their actual condition, such of
them as were disposed to reason ceased their
clamour, and answered thus: “Truly His Highness
Sultan Mahmoud was about to appoint a
deputation for the purpose of establishing this
exercise, according to the principles laid down
in the treatise entitled ‘The Origin of the Institution
of Discipline;’ but as longer life was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>not granted to him, the deputation was not
named. If at that period good order had been
established, we should not have been beaten by
the infidels.” In these words they made confession
of the truth; but some answered differently,
saying, “In the corps of Janissaries I
receive twenty-five aspers; if these troops of
the Nizam-y-Gedid should increase in number,
and become serviceable, I am afraid that as the
Janissaries will no longer enjoy any consideration,
I shall not be able to draw my pay. If I
knew for certain that no loss would accrue to
me from it, I would say, God grant that all the
people in the world may become soldiers of the
Nizam-y-Gedid.” These people expressed their
true sentiments. Others again spoke thus: “If
we abolish the new regulation (although we
know that it is likely to be serviceable, and that
our other undisciplined forces will never be of
the least avail) the enemy will celebrate the
event with the rejoicings of a marriage-feast,
and encroaching on our territories more and
more, will confirm their victory by imposing on
the Sublime Government hard and disgraceful
conditions; and to conclude, as there will be
no means of opposing the enemies of our faith
on any side, the power of the Sublime Government
will decline from day to day. If, under
the Divine favour, these troops who are clothed
with the garments of discipline, should be augmented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>until they amount to the number required,
and stationed in the fortresses upon the
Russian and German frontiers, as well as in
other parts of the empire, we very well know
that, in a time of trouble and of war, they will
not be disconcerted like our raw soldiers, but
will stand firm and unshaken in the midst of
carnage. We will prove the truth of our words
by this example: If, on a stormy day, a vessel
be manned with persons utterly ignorant of sea
affairs, the ship will undoubtedly sink, and all on
board will perish; but if the crew are acquainted
with navigation, however great may be the
storm which they encounter, they will, by the
grace of God, obtain a deliverance from it.
Can there be any room to doubt that a few
persons who have for fifteen or twenty years
exercised the art of war, and have learnt
sundry military stratagems, will obtain an easy
victory over many thousand unpractised soldiers,
overthrowing them, and bringing them into captivity?”
In such terms as these many of them
avowed their assent and conviction. It ought
to be generally known that, whilst many thousands
of our undisciplined forces were unable to
obtain the least advantage in the war which they
waged at Alexandria and Cairo against the reprobates
of France, our gunners and regular infantry,
although few in number, bravely combating
the infidels and defeated them incessantly; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>the flight of a single individual of that corps was
never seen nor heard of. As their valour was
conspicuous to all, many of those who had
carped at them saw and acknowledged their
error, saying  “these are the troops who will
render effectual service, and we have sinned in
calumniating them.” His Highness Gezar-Pashah
seeing the greatness of soul which these
men displayed in war, and with what heroic
courage they became martyrs, while not a single
individual thought of flight, spoke thus:  “Truly
before I knew what sort of men these were, I
was wont to abuse them;  but if after this I do so
again, may my tongue be dried in my mouth.”
This we have heard from persons who were present
at the time that he said it. If we possess
any understanding or sense of rectitude, and be
able to distinguish good from evil, we may perceive
and comprehend how important and necessary
the services of these troops have been; and
also that, with the exception of this sort of regular
soldiers, the residue of our forces have only
served to create confusion and occasion famine,
in our camps, frontier fortresses, and other military
posts. There are certain expressions current
amongst the enemies of our faith which our ears
heard in the time of our captivity. They say
thus:  “The greater is the number of troops
sent by the Ottomans into the field, the better
are we pleased; because if they are very numerous,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>their magazines will be exhausted, and
they will disperse before two months have
passed; and if your raw soldiers march against
us, the greater part of them will be mowed
down by our grape shot, and the remainder will
fly.” Behold, we have seen with our eyes that
this saying is exactly conformable to truth.
The following is another of their expressions:
“If, for instance, in an army of one hundred
thousand Ottomans, there could be found an
hundred well trained men, we should, in computing
their numbers, only reckon those hundred,
without taking the others into our calculation,
because we know that one soldier thoroughly
exercised, is equal to one thousand raw
and ignorant men.” It is a certain fact, that we
have seen in the wars persons who, having never
in the course of their lives taken a gun in
their hands before, but spent all their time in
the exercise of some trade, and knew not what
they were about, but first put the ball into their
muskets, and then the powder above it. It has
been sometimes proved by experience, that as
these people know not how to handle their ammunition,
it would be better that they should leave
the army rather than remain with it; because,
being of no use, they do harm by the disorder
which they create. Some of our raw soldiers
who do not know the proper charge of powder,
by putting too great a quantity into their guns,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>cause them to burst, and thus maim, or even kill
both themselves and those who stand near them;
and many of our unpractised horsemen who,
when mounted on their steeds, fancy themselves
the heroes of the age, and would not deign to
give a salutation even to their own fathers, when
they draw their sabres in action, wound the
heads of their own horses, and thus cover themselves
and their beasts with blood; this awkwardness
of theirs cause those who see it to
utter ejaculations of surprise. In short, it is
evident to men of understanding, that as the talents
of reading, writing, riding on horseback,
shooting with the bow, playing on an instrument,
and other similar acquirements, will not
come spontaneously to persons unskilled, and
uninstructed in them; so likewise victory cannot
be obtained without a knowledge of the art of
war, which is a particular, and noble branch of
science, independent of others.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are indeed certain considerations which
may induce us to pardon those calumniators of
the Nizam-y-Gedid, who are any wise connected
with the old corps; but do those persons who
are by no means attached to them, and who
know the difference between alum and<a id='r88'></a><a href='#f88' class='c012'><sup>[88]</sup></a>sugar,
and between good and evil, show any sense in
daring to abuse so noble a science? Their perverseness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>and obstinacy are astonishing, seeing
that, notwithstanding the taste which the infidel
race has always had of our raw troops, they do
not allow it to be sufficiently proved, that if a
war should break out, these ignorant beasts
pressing together in masses of one or two thousand
men, will be unable to resist the tactic of
the enemy.</p>

<h4 class='c022'>SECTION V.<br /> <em>Containing a relation of the footing on which the old corps of troops originally were, and of their present state.</em></h4>

<p class='c021'>Since so unreasonable a dissension prevails
between our old and new troops, we have undertaken
a disquisition on the organization of
the first of these corps. The public are well
aware of the conduct observed by our old corps
of troops when they march out to war, or return
from it; but if any persons should be ignorant of
this, we will thus explain it to them. At the time
that His Highness Sultan Suleÿman Khan set
on foot these forces, the soldiers whose names
were inscribed on the muster-roll conducted
themselves on their marches with the most perfect
propriety; and at the places through which
they passed, whether they moved by land or by
water, did not take so much as the value of an
asper, either from rich or poor, mussulman or
Rayah; neither did they eat a single egg without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>paying for it, nor injured the honour of any
one. Truly the said troops, yielding implicit
obedience to the orders of the emperor of the
times, and of their other commanders, performed
their duty well, and wronged no man in any
respect. In their military expeditions they
were wont to subdue forts and countries, and
to ruin the reputation of the infidels, and thus to
elevate the glory, fame, and power of the emperor
of exalted splendour, and as they were thought
worthy of the prayers of his Highness and of the
people of the true faith, the whole world held
them as objects of praise, and all men desired
their honour. As they were so highly respected
a body, they did not admit into their ranks men
of obscure race, such as Franks, Greeks, Armenians,
Jews, or gypsies, or persons belonging to
any other inglorious nation. Being men of true
courage, they repressed these as well as all other
insolent and shameless persons, and those of the
description of robbers. As the enemies of our
religion were not pleased with their excellent
regulations, they found means to introduce into
their ranks very cunning spies for the purpose
of sowing dissension amongst them. These
spies gradually creeping in amongst the soldiers
under pretence of being comrades, insinuated
themselves like Satan, and began by degrees to
set on foot practices, tending to corrupt the
valour implanted in their hearts, and their zeal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>for religion. “Comrades (said they) the pay
which we receive from government is seven
aspers, and they point out to us Paradise as the
reward of martyrdom; they will certainly cause
us all to be slaughtered by the infidels; we have
not two lives, why then should we be destroyed
for seven aspers, and without reason?” Having,
by similar and repeated insinuations, corrupted
the minds of the faithful soldiers, these began
to care no longer about the concerns they were
intended for, and saying at last, “Useless and
destructive expeditions are only proper for the
Russian infidels, let us leave it to their soldiers
to feed upon dry biscuits, as for us we will return
home and eat fine Baklava.”<a id='r89'></a><a href='#f89' class='c012'><sup>[89]</sup></a> Thus they
forgot the stream of benefits in which they were
immersed, and the kind treatment and protection
that they had experienced. As there was
nobody, either in the corps or out of it, who
spoke reason to them, they came in process of
time to do whatever they liked, plundering the
places that they traversed on their march, burning
and destroying the houses both of Mussulmans
and Rayahs, and stretching forth their
hands against the honour of their families. Besides
all this, although the whole body of men
who compose an hundred and ninety six Ortas,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>being quartered altogether in one residence,
ought to have no differences one with the other;
yet hatred and dissension rose to such a pitch
amongst them, that they no longer considered
those who did not belong to their own Orta,
as brothers in religion, but, without dissembling
their sentiments, exchanged bullets, and drank
each others blood; and in the villages, forcing
open the houses of the poor, committed murder,
which disorder still prevailing, as none of them
are safe from the others either in war or peace,
their well regulated system of discipline hath
perished and gone to decay. They pass their
days in propagating seventy thousand false reports,
saying, “When we were opposed to the
infidels, they did not allow us to give them
battle; if we had obtained permission, we could
without trouble have overthrown the crals from
their thrones; but the ministers of our government
conspiring with the Ghiaours<a id='r90'></a><a href='#f90' class='c012'><sup>[90]</sup></a> cause us to
be slain and taken prisoners, and, receiving from
the Russian infidels casks of gold, deliver up
the country to them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On a day of battle, as soon as they have
heard from a distance the noise of a cannonade,
and have seen a few hats, the Mussulman spies
who are in their ranks begin to exclaim aloud:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>“Community of Mahomet, why do you stay
here? the Ghiaours have forced our camp, the
troops in front of us have turned their faces this
way; we shall be pursued and made prisoners.”
As these cries spread in succession through the
army, even the very regiments which since
their original institution never surrendered their
kettles to the enemy<a id='r91'></a><a href='#f91' class='c012'><sup>[91]</sup></a>, and which are at that
moment sacrificing a thousand martyrs in their
defence, now estimating their own lives at the
price which the others set upon theirs, abandon
in the space of half an hour their tents, camp
equipage, kettles, and baggage of every sort,
and repairing straight to the imperial camp,
plunder the treasure, effects, and military chest,
and then adorning their heads with the trophies
of their pillage, walk about in small parties with
a presumptuous air, as though these were inscriptions
which made good their pretence of
having beaten the enemy, and overturned their
cral. As they are all mixed and confounded
together, there is no way of distinguishing
those who fight with true patriotism from those
who do not, and there are amongst them certain
adversaries who begin the attack against the
orders of their Vezier, Agha, Pashahs, and other
officers. When, however, the action is engaged,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>it is not possible to make them stand their
ground for half a minute, and the following
example is a clear proof of it. During the reign
of his Highness Sultan Moustapha, in the year
of the battle of Kartal, when an hundred and
fifty thousand soldiers of Islam were opposed
to the infidels, whilst his excellency, Cogia
Abdee Pashah (who hath attained to the mercy
of God,) was engaged in combat on the field of
battle, at which time the people of Islam were
not very hard pressed, a mounted spy, dressed
like a Chiaoush, rode hastily along the rear of
the entrenchments of the Janissaries, and cried
aloud: “Janissaries, why do you remain here?
the Ghiaours have turned our rear!” having
said these words, he put spurs to his horse and
departed. Before he was out of sight, the whole
camp of janissaries, without examining whether
he had spoken truth or falsehood, at once betook
themselves to a precipitate flight. The
infidels, availing themselves of the opportunity,
pursued them, and were on the point of completing
their destruction; but his excellency,
whom we mentioned above, saved them by
vigorously charging the infidels with another
corps; but while he thus checked the enemy,
the fugitives never thought so much as rallying
or coming to his assistance, neither did they
stop to take breath, until they arrived on the
banks of the Danube, amongst the tents which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>contained the treasure. As they did not see
the enemy at their backs, they ought to have
retraced their steps, instead of which, they plundered
the baggage and treasure of the imperial
camp, and not being able to cross the river in
open boats, they threw themselves into the river,
so that one third of them, or perhaps more,
were swallowed up in the Danube. Some, who
could not swim, climbed up the willow-trees
upon the banks of the Danube, and many lay
hid among the reeds and flags; but when the
enemy arrived and perceived them, they were
all put to death by fire and sword. It was exactly
three days before the whole army of the
infidels came up, when they made themselves
masters of all the artillery, ammunition, and
military stores of various descriptions, which
our bravoes, who were unable to carry them
off, had left on the banks of the Danube.</p>

<p class='c007'>Towards the conclusion of the Russian war,
which had succeeded the one we have been
speaking of, when Cogia Jussuf Pashah was
Grand Vezier for the second time, all the officers
of the corps, and the Janissary-Agha coming
up to the Vezier in a body, made to him this
representation: “Although we have upwards
of one hundred and twenty thousand men,
yet eight thousand of the Russian troops,
crossing to the higher side of the Danube and
attacking us, have completely routed our army.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>It is utterly impossible for us, with our regular
troops, to make head against such welldisciplined
forces as those of the Ghiaours;
therefore, if you intend to make peace with them,
do it without delay. While our soldiers continue
ignorant of these new military manœuvres, we
are not destined to become victorious, from this
time even to the day of judgment.” The astonished
Vezier said in answer to this strong representation,
“How can I lay these points before
the Emperor?” To this they replied, “We will
ourselves cause a petition to be drawn up and
presented to him.” At the same time, they
caused an humble representation to be written
out by me, and delivered it to the Vezier. It was
dispatched to the Emperor, and his Highness
became convinced of their inability of obtaining
success in future. When peace was made, in
consequence, the Sublime Government, considering
that the Janissaries themselves had declared
that their state of discipline rendered
them unfit to oppose the tactics of the enemies,
thought itself obliged to use every effort to introduce
into the corps of Janissaries a regular
system of exercise, hoping by that means to
retrieve their affairs, to avert defeat, to open the
way to victory, and to obtain security from
hostile machinations. The Janissaries, however,
contrary to reason and expectation, would not
receive this project, and absolutely rejected it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>But as it became evident that, if it were abandoned
to oblivion, things would become worse,
and the infidel race would certainly encroach
more and more, and as the conversation which
had taken place at Petersburgh relative to the
reservoirs, was then generally known, a body of
musketeers was formed from among the Bostangees,
and quartered in the barracks newly
constructed at the Levend-Chifflick. As when
His Highness Sultan Suleÿman set on foot the
corps of Janissaries, the new recruits deserted
next day, so in the present instance a number of
worthless persons set up an opposition in defence
of the Janissaries, although these were no otherwise
connected with it than by the simple reception
of pay, and began to whisper to each
other, “Hark ye! a hearth<a id='r92'></a><a href='#f92' class='c012'><sup>[92]</sup></a> is set open for the
Nizam-y-Gedid; if these new troops, who are
practising military evolutions, should perform
any good service in war, the institution of Janissaries
will become obsolete, and our muster-roll
will be erased from the list.” They suggested
also, that as the men who were inscribed in the
corps of the Nizam-y-Gedid performed an exercise
similar to that of the Ghiaours, the Mussulman
faith is thereby injured. Although these
blockheads had never before given themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>any concern about our faith or government, and
indeed knew nothing of what belongs to Mussulman
purity; yet, on the present occasion, they
showed a mighty anxiety for religion, and by that
means prevented many persons from inscribing
their names, and encouraged many who were already
engaged to desert. Behold! how inscrutable
are the decrees of Divine Providence! When
the war with France broke out, at which time
these forces consisted only of three or four
thousand men, the new gunners and musketeers
were appointed to serve at Cairo and Acre. The
said troops committed no excesses, either on
board the vessels in which they were transported,
or in the places of their destination whither they
repaired, nor robbed any man of the value of an
asper; but both in going and coming, conducted
themselves with propriety and modesty. If any
persons have either seen or heard of their having
committed the least fault, we challenge them to
declare it. When by the favour of Divine Providence
they arrived at Acre, the French infidels,
who had for sixty-three days pressed very closely
Gezar-Pashah and the inhabitants of the place,
were within a hair’s breadth of making themselves
entirely masters of it; for they had already entered
that which is called the Sublime bastion
within the fortress; but the troops of the Nizam-y-Gedid,
valiantly exerting their military skill, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>one day slaughtered the infidels to such a
degree, that in no part of Europe did the French
nation ever receive so disgraceful an overthrow;
and no man in the world is ignorant that the
said fortress and its inhabitants were delivered
by their courage. Is not this also a proof of
their utility, past and future? Wherever they
have been opposed to the infidels, although few
in number, they never turned their faces back,
but broke the enemy, or were themselves broken;
and as not one of them dared to mention the
word flight, they have always, in exact obedience
to the will of the great and mighty Prophet,
punctually discharged the duties which
appertain to a holy war, and a steady zeal for
the faith. If there is any falsehood in my words,
let any one prove it; I am extremely willing
that he should do so, otherwise, for God’s
sake, let every body listen to reason. When our
undisciplined forces in Egypt found themselves
unable to make head against the cavalry or infantry
of the French infidels, they retired for
protection behind the ranks of our regular troops,
who alone stood their ground, and by that means
saved themselves from the impending danger.
Moreover, in the year 1217 they were sent
against the Mountaineers who had rebelled in
Rumelia. Since that insolent race first showed
themselves, several Veziers and other officers had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>been sent against them without effect.<a id='r93'></a><a href='#f93' class='c012'><sup>[93]</sup></a> Having
formed the wicked design of destroying the
Nizam-y-Gedid institution from its roots, they
now exerted their whole strength and gave battle.
Although the regular troops had with them
neither their cannon, howitzers, or mounted
men, and were engaged in the midst of a severe
winter, snow, rain, and mud, and though the rebels
were strongly posted in a town, they nevertheless
marched up to the attack, and without regarding
the advantageous position of the insurgents,
while they were themselves up to the
knees in mud and water, they knocked down
half of the rebels like rotten pears, sending their
souls to hell, and obliged the rest to fly. In a
short time the field of action was covered with
the vile carcases of the rebels, and those who
were taken alive reported that they called out to
each other, “Ah! comrade, these troops which
they call Nizam-y-Gedid, are not what we took
them for.” In these exclamations they betrayed
the sense of their own inferiority. Every
one knows that at last these rascals, unable to
make a stand on any side, climbed the mountains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>by night, and fled. To this we may add,
that although the banditti tried by every means
to introduce a spy into the ranks of the new
soldiers, they could not succeed, because, by the
regulations of those forces, an officer is appointed
to command every ten privates, and these officers
who have an opportunity of seeing constantly,
as well their own men as those who are on the
right and left, are acquainted with them all, and
in the line they never quit each other’s sides; if,
therefore, a stranger from without should get in
amongst them, in what condition would he find
himself, being exposed in the middle; like a
broom in a court-yard, he delivers his collar to
the first man that takes him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just and intelligent men may readily understand
how easily the Sublime Government can
organise these troops, from this circumstance,
that it is utterly impossible for any person,
whether Mussulman or infidel, by passing to
and fro to examine the state of these troops,
and learn where they are going, and what they
are about to undertake, without being discovered
and punished. The advantages of the new
corps, and their superiority over the old are infinite;
were we to write them all down, we
should fill several volumes. In order, however,
to make the people comprehend well, we will
point out to them another of these advantages.
The soldiers of our ancient corps, are not at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>all clothed alike; from this diversity of garment,
the following bad effect results: if, in time of
war, any of them should desert from the army,
as there are no marks by which we can distinguish
whether the deserters belong to the troops,
or whether they are tradesmen, or servants, they
have thereby the opportunities of escaping without
being known. Whereas the new troops
have a particular uniform of their own, so that
the stragglers would be soon discovered. Hence
it results, that in a large camp of the new troops,
every man will be forced to remain fixed in
his company, and steady in the performance of
his duty, whether he would or no, since it is impossible
to desert without greatly incurring the
danger of punishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another of their advantages is this: our old
forces, when in presence of the enemy, do not
remain drawn up in a line, but stand confusedly
and promiscuously like a crowd in a place of
diversion. Some load their muskets, and fire
once, some twice, or oftener, just as they think
proper, whilst others being at their wits’ end,
and not knowing what they are about turn from
side to side like fabulous story-tellers.<a id='r94'></a><a href='#f94' class='c012'><sup>[94]</sup></a> If in
consequence of any movement which they perceive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>on the side of the enemy, the officers endeavour
to make the troops fall back a little,
some will obey them, others will not, every one
does just as he likes. If they wish to retire a
little, the soldiers make that a pretence for flying
to the distance of some days’ journey.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the new troops remain drawn up in line
as though they were at prayers, the rear ranks
being exactly parallel with the front, and consisting
of the same number of companies, neither
more nor less, so that, when it is necessary, they
turn with as much precision as a watch. The
whole body, consisting of many thousand men,
observe attentively the signals given them by
the two fuglemen who explain by signs the
commands of the officers, and not one dares so
much as to turn his head. Thus the orders of
the officers being communicated without the least
noise, they stand firm, and lend an attentive ear,
whilst not a word issues from their mouths. If,
for instance, the officer whose business it is to
give the command, makes the signal for attention,
the whole body are ready in an instant,
and not one of them dares to stand idle, or to
make any noise, or to look another way, thus
they are equally prepared for whatever may
happen. Sometimes the signal is given for
them to load and discharge their muskets successively,
without regarding order or slacken
their fire, so as to make the balls shower like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>rain. If, while thus engaged, they meet with
a check, the officers immediately by a signal will
cause them to retire in good order, and will
supply their place with fresh troops from the
rear, who likewise scatter their fire in the same
manner. This method of managing troops gives
great facility to their operations. Sometimes
they dispose a large body of men in a circular
form, and then cause them to march round in
such a manner, that as the circle turns the soldiers
incessantly discharge their muskets on the
enemy and give no respite to the combat, and
having prepared their guns for a fresh discharge
before they return to the same place, they fire
the moment they arrive in the face of the enemy.
The result of this circular formation is, that the
fire and slaughter do not cease for an instant.
Sometimes, when it is judged necessary, several
thousand men being crowded into a narrow space,
form a solid mass for the purpose of appearing to
the enemy to be few in number, then by opening
out, they can execute any manœuvre that they
please, and sometimes, ten thousand men deploying,
appear to consist of fifty or sixty thousand.
At other times, when they are hard pressed,
the troops receive the superior officers in the
centre, and throwing themselves into the form
of a square castle, pour their fire on every side,
the artillery also being disposed on every face
of the square, so that if the enemy should charge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>them even on four sides, he will be unable to
make an impression. If the enemy’s cavalry
should endeavour to break in upon them while
they are formed in this manner, on the signal
being given, the front rank men kneel altogether
in an instant, and remain in that position keeping
their muskets supported against their breasts,
and the ranks who are in their rear stand upright
and make use of their fire-arms, thus rendering
it impossible for the hostile cavalry to
break in and create confusion. Should it happen
that the enemy is as skilful and well trained
as themselves, and employs against them the
same discipline, then of the two parties, that
will be victorious whose chiefs are enabled, by
the favour of Divine Providence, to put in practice
with superior address, the new science and
stratagems of war which they have learned, because
the apostle of the Most High, our great
prophet (on whom be the blessings and peace of
God!) himself condescended to use military
stratagems. This sacred tradition is thus related.</p>

<p class='c007'>During a holy war which was carried on in
the happy time of the apostle of God, (on whom
be peace!) a certain valiant champion of the
enemy’s army came out to offer single combat,
and demanded that the glorious Alli should be
opposed to him. Alli, well pleasing to God,
having received the command of the Apostle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>girded on his sword only, and immediately went
forth alone to the place appointed for the combat.
When this friend of the Most High met
that infidel, he thus addressed him: “I come
on foot having one sword; why come you out
on horseback having two swords and two bows?”
The great Alli spoke to him again, saying “let
these things be so; but I come out alone to
give battle on our side, why do you bring another
man and come both together?” The infidel,
at this question, looked about him believing
that another man had followed him, when at the
same instant, the great Alli, in the twinkling of
an eye, made the vile head of the reprobate fly
off. The death of the said wicked person having
been a source of joy to the followers of
Islam, the excellent Alli, meeting the great prophet
on his return, related to him the admirable
stratagem by means of which he had slain that
wretch. This holy tradition has been vouchsafed
unto us.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although many similar stratagems have been
employed at various times, by holy warriors, and
leave has been granted to the spies sent forth
amongst the infidels for the purpose of advancing
victory to the people of Islam, to assume
any sort of dress; and although the great Prophet
hath given full permission and authority to
do any thing which may conduce to the defeat
of the infidels, yet an ignorant rabble keep chattering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>like parrots, some of whom do not approve
of the dresses of the new troops, while
others say that their exercise belongs specially
to the Kiafers<a id='r95'></a><a href='#f95' class='c012'><sup>[95]</sup></a>, and does not become Mussulmans.</p>

<p class='c007'>With respect to the manner in which the provinces
of the Sublime Government are to be defended,
and the means by which the enemies of
our faith are to be repressed, and the causes
that have produced victory and defeat, the rabble
are utterly ignorant of them, occupying
themselves solely with this question, “shall we
lose our pay of a few aspers?” With this, as
with a fishing hook, they draw from their sack
various absurdities, and prevent a number of
simple and foolish men from undertaking the
duties of holy warfare. In truth, is not this a
sufficient reason for their being excluded from
the two blessed worlds?</p>

<p class='c007'>To sum up all in one word: it is evident to
men of penetration, that there is no possibility of
introducing this system into our old corps, for
this reason; that as at their first institution they
were regulated in a different manner, every one
of them has an aversion to submitting himself to
the new discipline. If, for example, any of the
old troops wish to leave the camp and return,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>although forty thousand officers should attempt
to turn them back, it is useless; they will do as
they please. If only five or ten individuals
should turn their faces, who has power to say to
them “Stop, go not away!” the whole body
forthwith following on their steps; for the most
part draws breath in the tents containing the
treasure and baggage of the Imperial camp.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following is another of the advantages of
the new troops. If it should happen that the
enemies have obtained the victory by their superior
numbers, and that the new forces were defeated,
they will not, in consequence, lose
courage and disperse themselves; their captains
and other officers will rally them the following
day or soon after, and will again march
upon the enemy; and not one of their soldiers
will dare to make the defeat a pretext for quitting
his post. But if our old corps meet with a
small check, they run, throw themselves into the
water, and get drowned. Thus they become
the cause of the progress of the enemies of the
faith. Which thing having come to pass in our
own times, twice in the Russian, and once in
the Austrian war, and repeatedly in the war
with the French, is manifest to the world, and
wants no new proof.<a id='r96'></a><a href='#f96' class='c012'><sup>[96]</sup></a> Another of the advantages
of the new troops is this; that when a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>body of them are appointed to defend any post,
they establish an advanced guard round the
place in order to obviate any hostile stratagems.
Although this sort of vigilance and precaution
was formerly observed, yet there is a world of
difference between the ancient method and the
new. According to the old system, it is not
easy to discover strange soldiers of the enemies’
army who mix with the posts; but it is utterly
impossible for strangers to pass the guards of the
regular troops, and to get into a fortress which
they defend; so that the army is safe from
any surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following is a description of the manner
in which these posts are arranged. When they
are disposed round the camp, a certain word is
given them every night as a sign; the commander-in-chief first announces in secret this
word to the officers, and they communicate it
privately to the officers of the corps de garde; if
therefore they meet with a suspicious person, they
immediately demand the parole, that is to say,
the sign word for the night; and if he does not
give the parole of the night, they seize and conduct
him to the captain of the camp. Behold!
this is the only method of discovering spies;
and as it is a matter which, above all others, demands
great care, they will pay special attention
to it; so that until their return from any expedition,
the parole of one night will never be the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>same as that of another, and by this means they
are delivered from the plague of spies. But of
all the advantages, the most material is this. If,
under Divine favour, a sufficiently numerous
body of these new troops should be properly
disposed along the frontiers of the Sublime Empire,
our enemies will find themselves opposed
on every part of the boundaries of Islam, by expert
artillery men, and well disciplined forces,
perfectly acquainted with the rules of the art of
war; nor will they, as heretofore, be able to
take advantage of our unguarded posture, in
order to make an attack upon us; for there are
persons still alive who well know that when in
the time of Sultan Mahmoud the German infidels
assaulted, and at once made themselves
masters of the fortress of Nissa, it required a
great deal of trouble to drive them out. In
fine, His Highness the Emperor, and the supporters
of his power, considering that it is indispensably
necessary to guard against such occurrences
by striking terror into the enemies of our
religion, have firmly resolved to take measures
for that purpose, seeing that those enemies who
were from the beginning a troublesome and insolent
race, and who, in all times, had been
unable to withstand the power of the people
of Islam, insomuch that they were wont to
frighten their bastards in the cradle by saying
“The Mussulman is coming!” and many of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>them on seeing one Mussulman, took off their
hats through excess of fear, now venture to resist
us, and have with exceeding care and diligence
made themselves so thoroughly masters of
the use of fire-arms, that a body of some thousands
of them are able to serve their cannon with
as much precision and celerity as they can their
muskets, firing a single piece of artillery twelve
or fifteen times in a minute, and making a thousand
discharges in the space of an hour. By
this means they destroy the people of Islam from
a distance, and prevent them from making use
of their sabres. They now say, “At length we
have taught the Ottoman troops what value they
ought to set upon themselves; henceforth they
will never set foot in our country; even
the Mussulman provinces are ours.” Thus they
never allow victory to incline to the side of
Islam, and especially since the year 1182, they
have continued to afflict the followers of Islam
with most disgraceful usage, bringing under
their own power so many of our tributary subjects.
Nevertheless, a crowd of ignorant people
of our nation never bring these things into their
recollection, nor can persuade themselves that
the success of the infidels for nearly the space of
forty years over the people of Islam proceeds
entirely from their own inability to resist their
fire, and that their own frequent flights are the
cause which disables us from carrying on war.
These despicable wretches have never issued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>from the castle-gate, nor travelled a single stage
from home, neither do they know what war and
peace mean, nor from what cause the troubles of
the world have sprung, and whence they are
likely to arise in future; some of them are so
ignorant of what belongs to pure religion, that
in repeating a short prayer they commit mistakes
from beginning to end; men in appearance
only, vulgar of the lowest description,
children of falsehood, who suppose that the
Nizam-y-Gedid is the cause of confusion in the
universe, and that if this ordinance were removed,
and the old system restored, the world
would be tranquil in five days.</p>

<p class='c007'>Last year, one of those superlatively ignorant
persons was appointed to the office of receiver
of the revenue in one of the islands. This man,
who before was continually uttering curses and
execrations against the authors of the Nizam-y-Gedid,
having gained five thousand piasters by
the perception of the imposts, and hoping it was
continued to him for another year that he might
gain five thousand more, upon meeting with his
friends and companions, said to them, “Ha!
comrades, there is no harm in this Nizam-y-Gedid;
I, indeed, at first opposed it, but it was
from want of sense; for the impost upon wine
is not paid by those who drink it, but is levied
upon the wine which is sent to Russia, so that
the money comes out of the pockets of the Russians;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>it were better that it was twice as much;
I now understand the matter, and I make vow
never to speak a word against the Nizam-y-Gedid.”
See how this man, in consequence of
gaining a few piasters by an institution which
he had been in the habit of abusing, is not
ashamed afterwards to praise it. Such, however,
is the nature of all the lower orders. To sum
up all in one word: if the clamour and execrations
of a rabble, who makes no difference
between good and evil, obliges us to abandon
the said institution of new troops, (which Heaven
forbid!) the enemies of our religion will find so
much the more facility in invading us; and as
one of their kingdoms maintains three hundred
thousand regular troops, they will mount upon
our necks on seeing that the Ottomans cannot
discipline a hundred thousand. At that time
we shall not derive the least service from those
knaves who disapprove of the Nizam-y-Gedid;
they will merely say that it was thus ordained;
that there is no contending with destiny; and
if a great calamity befalls (which Heaven avert!)
they will, without making more words about
the matter, become the authors of trouble and
distress.</p>

</div>

<p class='c021'>In the time of his Highness the late Emperor,
during the period of my two captivities, I have
often, in the course of conversation with Russian
military men, questioned them, saying, “by
what secret prodigy hath it come to pass, that
you Muscovites, who were formerly a very stupid
and easily vanquished nation, have for some
time back obtained such success over the race
of Osman?” They, in reply, said, “Since you
are ignorant of the causes of our superiority,
you shall be made acquainted with them. The
Russians, in former times, did not possess the
knowledge of tactics, and were therefore beaten
by their enemies. A man called Mad <a id='r97'></a><a href='#f97' class='c012'><sup>[97]</sup></a>Petro,
having in his travels seen the world, and acquired
an intimate knowledge of the advantages
thereof, became Cral of Muscovy, and subjected
the Russians, whether they would or no, to the
restraints of discipline. In order to try what
progress they had made in it, he declared war
against the King of Sweden, and avenged himself
of him. He then went in an expedition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>towards the Crimea, reduced whatever fortresses
he thought proper, and began to break the power
of the Tartars. Afterwards, when we concluded
a treaty with you, we demanded for our Cral
the title of Emperor; and as you could not oppose
us, the Sultan Mahmoud Khan (of excellent
memory) in writing to us, granted that
title. Then in the war with Sultan Moustapha,
we approached Adrianople, and made peace on
our own terms. And see, in the present war,
we have, with very few troops, defeated your numerous
forces; and after taking the fortresses
of Hotim, Bender, Ibraïl, Ismail, and Otchakoff,
and conquering Moldavia and Wallachia from
one extremity to the other, we passed the Danube
with eight thousand men, and routed the
Ottoman army consisting of fifty thousand. As
you have no troops able to face ours, know that
this time also, after being well beaten, you will
make a worse peace than the former one.” In
this manner did they answer this poor person<a id='r98'></a><a href='#f98' class='c012'><sup>[98]</sup></a>;
and truly before much time had elapsed, it came
to pass that such a treaty was concluded.</p>

<h4 class='c022'>SECTION VII.</h4>

<p class='c021'>It is a difficult thing to find out the spies that
go to and fro in the camps of the followers of
Islam, and it is necessary to explain how much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>injury is done by them. As this matter requires
attention above all others, let us relate some
events which have happened to us, with the
consequences resulting from them.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the war with the Russians, during the reign
of the late Emperor, Sultan Moustapha, two
hundred thousand unknown and undisciplined
troops were drawn together. In this multitude
no one knew the other, and if a father had
searched for his own son, he could not have
found him. If each day some hundreds separated
themselves and went off, no one knew it,
nor even could have said to them, ‘stop! remain!’
In so disorderly a camp, the spies from
the side of the infidels came and went each day
and night, and acquainted the Russians with
every thing that passed in our army, and the
secrets of our government became known to the
enemy. For this reason, whenever a forward
movement of our army was resolved upon, they
surprised the camp towards morning, the day
before it was to be executed, and routed so large
an army of the Ottoman race, without allowing
them to open their eyes, all being buried in
sleep. We have learned by experience, that as
the infidel race are very cunning and deceitful,
they have often effected, merely by wiles and
stratagems, things which we never have been, nor
ever will be, able to bring about with our hundred
thousand men. Among all the wiles which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>that wicked race have put in practice, there is
one extraordinary stratagem which it is worth
while for us to describe. During the said war,
three poor men belonging to the assembly of
Janissaries, having concerted together, went out
to gain some information of the Russians: after
it was quite dark they seized, on the Muscovite
borders, a certain Ghiaour, one of those who were
employed in getting forage, and, satisfied with
their success, were conducting him to the camp,
when, their prisoner being a cunning hog<a id='r99'></a><a href='#f99' class='c012'><sup>[99]</sup></a> that
understood Turkish, said to them, “Sirs! if
you set me at liberty, my father, who is a rich
man, will recompense you largely.” They,
believing his words, conducted him back to the
Russian confines, where he soon found a surreptitious
pimp<a href='#f99' class='c012'><sup>[99]</sup></a> whom he called father, to whom
they delivered him. This man, who was also a
very deceitful rogue, said to them, “I am
greatly pleased at your bringing my son here and
not killing him, and I am very much obliged to
you.” With these and other expressions of gratitude,
he gave them five ducats, and continued
thus: “I have not been able to reward you as I
ought to do, but allow me to show you something,
and let that be another recompense.” So
saying, he carried them in disguise into his own
camp, and placed them at the edge of a large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>tent; here the comrades perceived that there
was a great bustle before the tent, and that
within they were weighing gold and silver coin
in a large balance, and were then filling with it
some casks placed near. In the tent were men
habited in divers sorts of Mussulman dresses,
and the casks filled with money were continually
distributed amongst them. The traitor, after
showing these things to the three comrades, took
them to his own tent, and said to them, “Comrades!
see what I have shown you. Part of this
money is to go to your government, and part to
the Vezier and other Generals of your army. We
have purchased your country with money; the
sum that has just been given is the price of Constantinople
which we have bought and shall soon
enter. My motive for informing you of this is
that you may henceforth look to yourselves; do
not remain in your camp, nor even lose time at
Constantinople; but go to your own country
that you may not be made prisoners. Keep all
this secret, and say nothing of it in your camp.”
With these words he led them back to the Ottoman
confines. The comrades returned to our
camp, and being all three simple fools, they gave
implicit confidence to the falsehood contrived to
deceive them; and whenever they met their
friends and acquaintances they said to them,
“Breh! what did we come here for? Our chiefs
have sold their country and are now receiving the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>money for it: we have seen it with our own
eyes; why should we stay here? all that passes
is but lost labour.” By this means they struck
with consternation many who were as great asses
as themselves, and these spread confusion and
alarm through the whole Imperial camp. Finding
this pretext of going home, a great number
of the troops went off and dispersed, like a
flock of young partridges.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Russian hogs, availing themselves of so
favourable an opportunity, brought the devil
among us. But the best of the story is, that
they all laughed at us in relating it to each other,
saying that in order to disperse a Turkish army,
they had only to weigh a little gold in the presence
of three of their men, and then send
them to inform the rest of it. Thus, on account
of so many ignorant fools, who understand
nothing of the wiles and machinations of the
enemy, it is necessary that we should give our
troops such a form of discipline as may prevent
similar disorders, and the danger of the spies
who mix with our men and can never be discovered.</p>

<p class='c007'>How is it possible for us without such a system,
to avenge ourselves of our enemies, to defend
our Empire, or to gain the least advantage? As
the deep cunning of the Russian race was not at
first so well known, our precious heroes of soldiers
made use of such expressions. “The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>Muscovite infidels are dogs of fishermen, whom
we can suffocate only by spitting upon them; if
we each of us throw a stone, we shall destroy
them all.” These Janissaries who are merely vain
boasters, good only for swaggering on the pavements,
falling by thousands into the hands of
the Russians through their total ignorance of military
affairs, at length saw and learned the power
and stratagems of the enemies of our faith. But
to what purpose? since the children and daughters
of so many noble and pious persons of the
Mahometan community have continued even to
this day (a space of nearly forty years!) in the
possession of the Russians; and the children
whom they have produced remain depressed and
afflicted, a weeping prey in the hands of soldiers,
officers, and other reprobates.<a id='r100'></a><a href='#f100' class='c012'><sup>[100]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>If a rabble of men, ignorant of the world, who
pass their whole time in festivity and play, or in
buying and selling, or in idleness, were in the first
place to learn thoroughly the things which belong
to purity, and then, in order to preserve their
religion unsullied, were to avoid discourse with
infidels and designing men, and examine whether
their own observance of it did not require some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>correction, there is no doubt that they might
attain to the summit of the good things, both of
this world and of the world to come. If they
contend with us, saying, “We understand questions
of purity, we preserve our religion, and
there is no doubt of the validity of our marriage
contract<a id='r101'></a><a href='#f101' class='c012'><sup>[101]</sup></a>”; in that case, although what they
maintain be true, yet, as the knowledge of the
affairs of this world is apt to occasion many great
sins, let them not lengthen their tongues on a
subject of which they certainly know nothing,
and to which their understandings cannot reach.
If this business of the Nizam-y-Gedid seem obscure
to them, let them acquire information from
men who, like this humble individual<a id='r102'></a><a href='#f102' class='c012'><sup>[102]</sup></a>, have
reached their eighty-seventh year, and have
gained by experience a thorough knowledge of
the world, and have brought to light what things
have injured, and what have turned to the profit
of, the Sublime Government. Let them not talk
of things void of sense, for as the troubles of

<p class='c021'>Many simple persons, who do not know why
the treasure of the Nizam-y-Gedid was instituted,
and whence this money is collected, and to
what purpose it is expended, say sometimes,
“the water of the old cistern is not exhausted;
why then is the new revenue made a separate
treasure?”<a id='r103'></a><a href='#f103' class='c012'><sup>[103]</sup></a> We have already stated how difficult
a thing it is to explain public affairs to people
who are plunged in the darkest ignorance, and
to make those who cannot read the common
alphabet understand science; although we were
to labour until the day of judgment, we should
not succeed. If a man is capable of receiving
the words of truth from his outward ears into
his mind, we proceed to relate matters as they
really are.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wars have been carried on for seventy or
eighty years in a rude manner, and with weak
and irregular troops, during which time the followers
of Islam having been often defeated, His
Highness Sultan Suleÿman Kannuni thought proper
to form the body of the Janissaries, whom he
divided into different divisions, assigning to each
their particular regiments and quarters. He
considered, however, that these troops could not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>be assembled and kept together for the love of
God only, but that it was also necessary to
establish funds for the purpose of providing
meat, drink, &amp;c. for them, as well as to appoint
them a pay suitable to their expenses.
After consulting with the wise and experienced
men of the time, he regulated the administration
of the revenue in the following manner. A
small part of the monies drawn from the provinces
that had, by right of conquest, become
subject to his illustrious predecessors, was appropriated
to the subsistence of military men who
served on horseback and otherwise. The Emperor
appointed by the canon<a id='r104'></a><a href='#f104' class='c012'><sup>[104]</sup></a> that, from the
annual product of the revenues, and from the
sums which every one who succeeded to the
farming of them, paid according to his means, as
an anticipation price, provision should be made
for meeting the expense incident to these corps,
whether in war or in peace. After these arrangements
had been made, it frequently happened
that, in good times, no war took place for
twenty years together, during which some of the
military men who belonged to the corps, having
turned old, departed in peace. As the papers
granted them to enable them to draw their pay
fell into the hands of their servants, relations, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>comrades<a id='r105'></a><a href='#f105' class='c012'><sup>[105]</sup></a>, it was not suffered that the allowances
appointed for several thousand men
should be received by persons who did not belong
to the military profession, who were novices
in affairs, or apprenticed to some trade. As
few of them left sons capable of taking the
place of their fathers, and opposing the enemies
of our faith, men of war became very scarce,
and it was therefore necessary to levy fresh
troops, and assign new funds for their support,
the old revenue being exhausted. Besides this
cause of the impoverishment of the royal treasure,
the price of all commodities had greatly
augmented since the time that the canon was
promulgated. For instance, at that period an
oke of the flesh of mutton was sold for four aspers,
but in the course of time it rose to twenty-five
paras, and other things were dearer in proportion.
Thus an increase having taken place
in the price of the necessaries which were furnished
to the corps at its institution, the royal
funds provided for that purpose were no longer
able to meet the expense of the times, and as
they were nevertheless obliged to find some
means of going on, the rents of the Sublime Government
began to run into each other; that is
to say, that in order to provide for the expense
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>of the current year, they sold the revenue of the
succeeding one, and so on. Hence resulted a
deficiency in the Imperial finances. Even the
treasures, which had been amassed with a great
deal of trouble previous to the Russian war that
broke out during the reign of the late Sultan
Mustapha, were in that war entirely drained and
consumed, although every thing was then very
cheap when compared with present prices, and
after peace, the finances could not recover themselves,
but the expense still exceeded the revenue.
The enemies of our religion being informed
of our want of money, were thereby confirmed
in their purpose, and obtained complete
success. But besides the difficulties in which
our government found itself involved in peaceable
times, owing to the deficiency of the ordinary
revenue which did not suffice for the current
expenses, there have been moments during war in
which it stood like a man who has both his hands
tied down to his sides, and knew not which way
to turn itself; for as there was no ready money,
nothing could be accomplished, and nobody
showed any inclination to engage in a holy war;
nothing was considered but pay, rations, and
the privilege of being exempted from active
service.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus hath the want of a well-organised system
of finance been clearly proved, the whole revenue
of the state not being sufficient for the exigencies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>of these times. The following example will
point out the truth of this to the people at large.
Suppose the case of a man, who twenty or
thirty years ago enjoyed an income of one
piaster a day, and regulated his expenses
accordingly, if that man continued on the same
scale how could he live at present, when every
thing is four or five times dearer than at that
period, and make the two ends of the year meet
with his piaster a day? In like manner, we may
apply this consideration to the actual condition
of the Sublime Government. Behold,
while the royal finances are in so great a state of
penury, not a single person, whether rich, poor,
or tributary subject, will give a single piaster to
the treasure, under the name of a voluntary
contribution, towards carrying on war; and, in
short, no man will go to war gratis, and at his
own expense, only to please God, or for the
love of the prophet or the emperor; the formation
of troops proportioned to those of the
enemy, and the providing of military stores,
which may equal theirs, are things which must
be accomplished, not by words, but by money.
The truth is, that the treasury does not possess a
fixed revenue sufficient to defray contingent
expenses, and, to sum up all, the old revenues
of the Sublime Government were calculated for
the old expense; and as two hundred and forty-five
years have elapsed since the publication of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>the canon, the expense having constantly
increased whilst the revenue was never augmented,
His Highness, the Emperor, has looked
out for some remedy in such difficult circumstances,
and has laboured to establish a revenue
proportioned to the amount of expenditure of
these times. But that the requisite funds
might neither be taken by violence, nor derived
from casual contingency, it was thought proper
to draw them from the peculiar possessions of
the government and the sources dependent
thereon. A treasure having been with much
difficulty amassed, in which were to be deposited
the money raised under the title of Iradi-Gedid,
the following reflections presented themselves
relative to the manner in which they were to be
regulated.</p>

<p class='c007'>The produce of the imposts at the time that
the canon was promulgated, was farmed out in
small branches to those who bid for them the
highest, and authority was granted to them to
receive each a part of the tribute on their
advancing a certain sum in proportion to their
respective means, and on condition of their paying
a thousand piasters a year to the crown
besides; thus a man was able in three years to
reimburse himself of the small sum which he had
advanced, and then if the contract was continued
to him for the course of his life, he could make
a clear profit of forty or fifty thousand piasters;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>and perhaps of an hundred thousand if he lived
long enough. The contractors continuing to
give the crown only a thousand piasters after
the first small sum advanced, the whole benefit
of the revenue accrued to them, but the profits
of the public treasure were not augmented and
continued the same. A new method having,
therefore, been found absolutely necessary, has
been adopted, and in such a manner as to leave
no person any pretext for complaint. The
arrangement is this: that when the perception
of an impost, which belongs by right to the
treasury, falls vacant, it is no longer farmed out
in consideration of a small sum, but is taken
possession of on the part of the Sublime Government,
and the management of it is carried on
for the benefit of the new treasury; the sum
which continues to be paid to the crown, as
well as the profits derived from the perception
of the impost, are appropriated to the pay,
clothing, and allowances of the troops of the
Nizam-y-Gedid, and to the special exigencies of
the war department, such as the providing of
cannon, ammunition, tents, camp equipage,
military stores, and the expenses of the park and
train of artillery.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the accountants of the old treasury are
wholly employed in the collection and management
of the funds appertaining to it, a director
was specially appointed for the purpose of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>watching over that part of the administration,
and by his ability the whole has been properly
regulated. These are then the advantages
which result from the expense of the troops
being defrayed by this new financial arrangement.
The old revenue hath not been thereby
prejudiced, and the charges of the new troops
are provided for. This business has been conducted
in so masterly a manner that no just
cause is left to any one to cry out against it;
and the new revenue, like the new system of
discipline, being established on the best footing,
causes no loss or damage to any man, but, on
the contrary, tends manifestly to perpetuate,
until the last day, the duration of the empire
and of the people of Islam, as must be evident
to all persons endowed with penetration.</p>

<p class='c007'>When we have by so distinct an exposition
rendered all these points clear, those men who
are acquainted with the difference between
alum and sugar, good and bad, and in whose
essence is a leaven of science, will, no doubt,
listen to reason, and, by Divine grace, being
brought under conviction, will submit themselves
to the book of God, mighty and powerful!</p>

Mr. Thornton says, “The Boyars of the most ancient
families, indeed, assert that they are the descendants of
the Slavi, and are of a distinct race from the people
who have sprung from the alliances of the Romans with
the original Dacians; but the chief distinction among
the nobles is their wealth and possessions. The great
majority of the Wallachian and Moldavian nobility owe
their creation to the Sultan’s Voïvodes; for even these
ephemeral beings, these fleeting shadows of royalty, are
presumed to confer by their breath a permanency of dignity,”
&amp;c. I perfectly agree with Mr. Thornton as to
the latter part of this observation; but at the same time
I must beg leave to say, that although I am well acquainted
with all the Boyars who are considered to belong
to the most ancient families, I never could discover
that their claims to antiquity went beyond the period of
Raddo Negro’s and Bogdan’s establishment; nor indeed
are there many sufficiently conversant with the history
of their country, or with any other, to know that the
Slaves ever came into it, or even that a nation of that
name ever existed. Those who call themselves the
oldest families merely date their origin from Voïvodes,
who have reigned within the last five hundred years;
and upon such origin alone they form their claims to
ancient nobility.</p>

was concluded, the Russian authorities withdrew, and

<p class='c007'><a href='#r43'>43</a>. “It may be questioned whether it ever entered into
the contemplation of the Russian cabinet to ameliorate
the condition of the inhabitants of Wallachia and Moldavia,
since no instance can be produced of any exertion
of influence on the part of the Russian consuls
to alleviate the distresses of the people, to check and
restrain the tyranny of the Greeks, or to promote any
plan of permanent benefit to the oppressed inhabitants.”—<em>Thornton</em>’s
Present State of Turkey, p. 435.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mere motives of good-will on the part of the Russian
cabinet, are certainly questionable; but several instances
of interference have occurred. In the official note given
as a declaration of war in 1789, by the Turkish government
to the Russian envoy, the composition of which was
then attributed to the English ambassador, Sir Robert
Ainslie, one of the principal grievances alleged was the
conduct of the Russian consul-general at Yassi, who,
it was said, had abused the right of interference in a
most insulting manner. It may be supposed that the
consul had acted in conformity to instructions from his
court, who sought to create motives for a rupture;
but after the conclusion of pence, nearly the same line of
conduct was continued by his successors: I have seen
many official documents which prove it; and during my
residence in the principalities, several instances have
occurred, within my observation, of very active exertion
on the part of Russia to keep the accustomed system of
extortion in restraint, and to relieve the inhabitants from
oppression; and such exertion has certainly on many occasions
prevented the condition of the inhabitants from
becoming worse.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f44'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r44'>44</a>. Whenever the Russian or Austrian armies have
entered the territory of the principalities in their wars
against Turkey, the natives have immediately joined
them. At the beginning of the war in 1806, Bukorest
was garrisoned by about 10,000 Turks, who declared
themselves determined to make a desperate stand against
the Russians, and to burn the city, if they should finally
see the impossibility of preventing them from taking
possession of it. Some inhabitants gave information of
this plan to the Russian commander-in-chief Michaelson,
who immediately despatched to Bukorest a corps of 6000
men under the command of General Miloradovith, which,
by forced marches arrived suddenly before that city, and
three days previous to the time they were expected by the
Turks. These latter were seized with consternation;
all the inhabitants rose against them, and some armed
with sticks, others with bricks, tongs, pokers, daggers,
swords, and with every thing, in short, that came within
their reach, they fell upon the poor Ottomans without
mercy, and cleared the town of them as the Russians
were entering it. More than 1500 Turks were left
dead in the streets, and the Cossacks, who preceded
the regular troops, soon reduced them to a state of
nudity, in which they remained exposed to the view of
the public some hours after tranquillity and order had
been restored.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r72'>72</a>. It is believed that the Empress Catherine had formed
the plan of a similar expedition, and that her death prevented
its timely execution. When in 1812, the approaching war
between France and Russia rendered the cessation of hostilities,
on the Turkish frontiers, absolutely necessary to the
future operations of the Russians against the French, it had
been determined, and measures were taken accordingly, that
an army composed of regular troops, marines, and militiamen,
amounting to fifty thousand men, under the command
of the Duke of Richelieu, should have been transported
from Sevastopol in the Crimea to Domouzdéré, where its
landing was to be effected under the protection of a fleet,
commanded by Admiral Bailie. This army was to take possession
of the reservoirs, and the Turks by whom the event
would have been perfectly unexpected and unforeseen,
would, no doubt, have been compelled to sign peace immediately.
This bold scheme was to have been executed in
case any new difficulties had arisen in the negotiations of
Bukorest. It has been kept so secret, that it is doubtful
whether any Turk suspects, even at the present day, its having
been conceived and seriously intended.</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
